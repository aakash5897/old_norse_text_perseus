Thereafter came Regin to Sigurd, and said, "Hail, lord andmaster, a noble victory hast thou won in the slaying of Fafnir,whereas none durst heretofore abide in the path of him; and nowshall this deed of fame be of renown while the world standsfast."Then stood Regin staring on the earth a long while, and presentlythereafter spake from heavy-mood: "Mine own brother hast thouslain, and scarce may I be called sackless of the deed."Then Sigurd took his sword Gram and dried it on the earth, andspake to Regin --"Afar thou faredst when I wrought this deed and tried this sharpsword with the hand and the might of me; with all the might andmain of a dragon must I strive, while thou wert laid alow in theheather-bush, wotting not if it were earth or heaven."Said Regin, "Long might this worm have lain in his lair, if thesharp sword I forged with my hand had not been good at need tothee; had that not been, neither thou nor any man would haveprevailed against him as at this time."Sigurd answers, "Whenas men meet foes in fight, better is stoutheart than sharp sword."Then said Regin, exceeding heavily, "Thou hast slain my brother,and scarce may I be sackless of the deed."Therewith Sigurd cut out the heart of the worm with the swordcalled Ridil; but Regin drank of Fafnir's blood, and spake,"Grant me a boon, and do a thing little for thee to do.  Bear theheart to the fire, and roast it, and give me thereof to eat." Then Sigurd went his ways and roasted it on a rod; and when theblood bubbled out he laid his finger thereon to essay it, if itwere fully done; and then he set his finger in his mouth, and lo,when the heart-blood of the worm touched his tongue, straightwayhe knew the voice of all fowls, and heard withal how the wood-peckers chattered in the brake beside him --"There sittest thou, Sigurd, roasting Fafnir's heart for another,that thou shouldest eat thine ownself, and then thou shouldestbecome the wisest of all men."And another spake: "There lies Regin, minded to beguile the manwho trusts in him."But yet again said the third, "Let him smite the head from offhim then, and be only lord of all that gold."And once more the fourth spake and said, "Ah, the wiser were heif he followed after that good counsel, and rode thereafter toFafnir's lair, and took to him that mighty treasure that lieththere, and then rode over Hindfell, whereas sleeps Brynhild; forthere would he get great wisdom.  Ah, wise he were, if he didafter your redes, and bethought him of his own weal; `for wherewolf's ears are, wolf's teeth are near.'"Then cried the fifth: "Yea, yea, not so wise is he as I deem him,if he spareth him whose brother he hath slain already."At last spake the sixth: "Handy and good rede to slay him, and belord of the treasure!"Then said Sigurd, "The time is unborn wherein Regin shall be mybane; nay, rather one road shall both these brothers fare."And therewith he drew his sword Gram and struck off Regin's head. Then heard Sigurd the wood-peckers a-singing, even as the songsays. (1)For the first sang:"Bind thou, Sigurd,The bright red rings!Not meet it isMany things to fear.A fair may know I,Fair of all the fairestGirt about with gold,Good for thy getting."And the second:"Green go the waysToward the hall of GiukiThat the fates show forthTo those who fare thither;There the rich kingReareth a daughter;Thou shalt deal, Sigurd,With gold for thy sweetling."And the third:"A high hall is thereReared upon Hindfell,Without all around itSweeps the red flame aloft.Wise men wroughtThat wonder of hallsWith the unhidden gleamOf the glory of gold."Then the fourth sang:"Soft on the fellA shield-may sleepethThe lime-trees' red plaguePlaying about her:The sleep-thorn set Odin Into that maidenFor her choosing in warThe one he willed not."Go, son, beholdThat may under helmWhom from battleVinskornir bore,From her may not turnThe torment of sleep.Dear offspring of kingsIn the dread Norns' despite."Then Sigurd ate some deal of Fafnir's heart, and the remnant hekept.  Then he leapt on his horse and rode along the trail of theworm Fafnir, and so right unto his abiding-place; and he found itopen, and beheld all the doors and the gear of them that theywere wrought of iron: yea, and all the beams of the house; and itwas dug down deep into the earth: there found Sigurd goldexceeding plenteous, and the sword Rotti; and thence he took theHelm of Awe, and the Gold Byrny, and many things fair and good.So much gold he found there, that he thought verily that scarcemight two horses, or three belike, bear it thence.  So he tookall the gold and laid it in two great chests, and set them on thehorse Grani, and took the reins of him, but nowise will he stir,neither will he abide smiting.  Then Sigurd knows the mind of thehorse, and leaps on the back of him, and smites and spurs intohim, and off the horse goes even as if he were unladen.

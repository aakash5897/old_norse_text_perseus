Now King Lyngi made for the king's abode, and was minded to takethe king's daughter there, but failed herein, for there he foundneither wife nor wealth; so he fared through all the realm, andgave his men rule thereover, and now deemed that he had slain allthe kin of the Volsungs, and that he need dread them no more fromhenceforth.Now Hjordis went amidst the slain that night of the battle, andcame whereas lay King Sigmund, and asked if he might be healed;but he answered --"Many a man lives after hope has grown little; but my good-haphas departed from me, nor will I suffer myself to be healed, norwills Odin that I should ever draw sword again, since this mysword and his is broken; lo now, I have waged war while it washis will.""Naught ill would I deem matters," said she, "if thou mightest behealed and avenge my father."The king said, "That is fated for another man; behold now, thouart great with a man-child; nourish him well; and with good heed,and the child shall be the noblest and most famed of all our kin:and keep well withal the shards of the sword: thereof shall agoodly sword be made, and it shall be called Gram, and our sonshall bear it, and shall work many a great work therewith, evensuch as eld shall never minish; for his name shall abide andflourish as long as the world shall endure: and let this be enowfor thee.  But now I grow weary with my wounds, and I will go seeour kin that have gone before me."So Hjordis sat over him till he died at the day-dawning; and thenshe looked, and behold, there came many ships sailing to theland: then she spake to the handmaid --"Let us now change raiment, and be thou called by my name, andsay that thou art the king's daughter."And thus they did; but now the vikings behold the great slaughterof men there, and see where two women fare away thence into thewood; and they deem that some great tidings must have befallen,and they leaped ashore from out their ships.  Now the captain ofthese folks was Alf, son of Hjalprek, king of Denmark, who wassailing with his power along the land.  So they came into thefield among the slain, and saw how many men lay dead there; thenthe king bade go seek for the women and bring them thither, andthey did so.  He asked them what women they were; and, little asthe thing seems like to be, the bondmaid answered for the twain,telling of the fall of King Sigmund and King Eylimi, and manyanother great man, and who they were withal who had wrought thedeed.  Then the king asks if they wotted where the wealth of theking was bestowed; and then says the bondmaid --"It may well be deemed that we know full surely thereof."And therewith she guides them to the place where the treasurelay: and there they found exceeding great wealth; so that mendeem they have never seen so many things of price heaped uptogether in one place.  All this they bore to the ships of KingAlf, and Hjordis and bondmaid went them.  Therewith these sailaway to their own realm, and talk how that surely on that fieldhad fallen the most renowned of kings.So the king sits by the tiller, but the women abide in theforecastle; but talk he had with the women and held theircounsels of much account.In such wise the king came home to his realm with great wealth,and he himself was a man exceeding goodly to look on.  But whenhe had been but a little while at home, the queen, his mother,asked him why the fairest of the two women had the fewer ringsand the less worthy attire."I deem," she said, "that she whom ye have held of least accountis the noblest of the twain."He answered: "I too have misdoubted me, that she is little like abondwoman, and when we first met, in seemly wise she greetednoble men.  Lo now, we will make trial of the thing."So on a time as men sat at the drink, the king sat down to talkwith the women, and said: --"In what wise do ye note the wearing of the hours, whenas nightgrows old, if ye may not see the lights of heaven?"Then says the bondwoman, "This sign have I, that whenas in myyouth I was wont to drink much in the dawn, so now when I nolonger use that manner, I am yet wont to wake up at that verysame tide, and by that token do I know thereof."Then the king laughed and said, "Ill manners for a king'sdaughter!"  And therewith he turned to Hjordis, and asked hereven the same question; but she answered --"My father erst gave me a little gold ring of such nature, thatit groweth cold on my finger in the day-dawning; and that is thesign that I have to know thereof."The king answered: "Enow of gold there, where a very bondmaidbore it!  But come now, thou hast been long enow hid from me; yetif thou hadst told me all from the beginning, I would have doneto thee as though we had both been one king's children: butbetter than thy deeds will I deal with thee, for thou shalt be mywife, and due jointure will I pay thee whenas thou hast borne mea child."She spake therewith and told out the whole truth about herself:so there was she held in great honour, and deemed the worthiestof women.

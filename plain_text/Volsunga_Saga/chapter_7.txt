So on a tide it befell as Signy sat in her bower, that there cameto her a witch-wife exceeding cunning, and Signy talked with herin such wise, "Fain am I," says she, "that we should changesemblances together."She says, "Even as thou wilt then."And so by her wiles she brought it about that they changedsemblances, and now the witch-wife sits in Signy's placeaccording to her rede, and goes to bed by the king that night,and he knows not that he has other than Signy beside him.But the tale tells of Signy, that she fared to the earthhouse ofher brother, and prayed him give her harbouring for the night;"For I have gone astray abroad in the woods, and know not whitherI am going."So he said she might abide, and that he would not refuse harbourto one lone woman, deeming that she would scarce pay back hisgood cheer by tale-bearing: so. she came into the house, and theysat down to meat, and his eyes were often on her, and a goodlyand fair woman she seemed to him; but when they are full, then hesays to her, that he is right fain that they should have but onebed that night; she nowise turned away therefrom, and so forthree nights together he laid her in bed by him.Thereafter she fared home, and found the witch-wife and bade herchange semblances again, and she did so.Now as time wears, Signy brings forth a man-child, who was namedSinfjotli, and when he grew up he was both big and strong, andfair of face, and much like unto the kin of the Volsungs, and hewas hardly yet ten winters old when she sent him to Sigmund'searth-house; but this trial she had made of her other sons orever she had sent them to Sigmund, that she had sewed gloves onto their hands through flesh and skin, and they had borne it illand cried out thereat; and this she now did to Sinfjotli, and hechanged countenance in nowise thereat.  Then she flayed off thekirtle so that the skin came off with the sleeves, and said thatthis would be torment enough for him; but he said --"Full little would Volsung have felt such a smart this."So the lad came to Sigmund, and Sigmund bade him knead their mealup, while he goes to fetch firing; so he gave him the meal-sack,and then went after the wood, and by then he came back hadSinfjotli made an end of his baking.  Then asked Sigmund if hehad found nothing in the meal."I misdoubted me that there was something quick in the meal whenI first fell to kneading of it, but I have kneaded it all uptogether, both the meal and that which was therein, whatsoever itwas."Then Sigmund laughed out, he said --"Naught wilt thou eat of this bread to-night, for the most deadlyof worms (1) hast thou kneaded up therewith."Now Sigmund was so mighty a man that he might eat venom and haveno hurt therefrom; but Sinfjotli might abide whatso venom came onthe outside of him, but might neither eat nor drink thereof.

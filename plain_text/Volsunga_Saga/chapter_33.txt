Now so it is, that whoso heareth these tidings sayeth, that nosuch an one as was Sigurd was left behind him in the world, norever was such a man brought forth because of all the worth ofhim, nor may his name ever minish by eld in the Dutch Tongue norin all the Northern Lands, while the world standeth fast.The story tells that, on a day, as Gudrun sat in her bower, shefell to saying, "Better was life in those days when I had Sigurd;he who was far above other men as gold is above iron, or the leekover other grass of the field, or the hart over other wildthings; until my brethren begrudged me such a man, the first andbest of all men; and so they might not sleep or they had slainhim.  Huge clamour made Grani when he saw his master and lordsore wounded, and then I spoke to him even as with a man, but hefell drooping down to the earth, for he knew that Sigurd wasslain."Thereafter Gudrun gat her gone into the wild woods, and heard onall ways round about her the howling of wolves, and deemed deatha merrier thing than life.  Then she went till she came to thehall of King Alf, and sat there in Denmark with Thora, thedaughter of Hakon, for seven seasons, and abode with goodwelcome.  And she set forth her needlework before her and didthereinto many deeds and great, and fair plays after the fashionof those days, swords and byrnies, and all the gear of kings, andthe ship of King Sigmund sailing along the land; yea, and theywrought there how they fought, Sigar and Siggeir, south in Fion.Such was their disport; and now Gudrun was somewhat solaced ofher grief.So Grimhild comes to hear where Gudrun has take up her abode, andshe calls her sons to talk with her, and asks whether they willmake atonement to Gudrun for her son and her husband, and saidthat it was but meet and right to do so.Then Gunnar spake, and said that he would atone for her sorrowswith gold.So they send for their friends, and array their horses, theirhelms, and their shields, and their byrnies, and all their war-gear; and their journey was furnished forth in the noblest wise,and no champion who was of the great men might abide at home; andtheir horses were clad in mail-coats, and every knight of themhad his helm done over with gold or with silver.Grimhild was of their company, for she said that their errandwould never be brought fairly to pass if she sat at home.There were well five hundred men, and noble men rode with them.There was Waldemar of Denmark, and Eymod and Jarisleif withal.  So they went into the hall of King Alf, and there abode them theLongbeards and Franks, and Saxons: they fared with all their war-gear, and had over them red fur-coats.  Even as the song says --"Byrnies short cut,Strong helms hammered,Girt with good swords,Red hair gleaming."They were fain to choose good gifts for their sister, and spakesoftly to her, but in none of them would she trow.  Then Gunnarbrought unto her a drink mingled with hurtful things, and thisshe must needs drink, and with the king thereof she had no morememory of their guilt against her.But in that drink was blended the might of the earth and the seawith the blood of her son; and in that horn were all letters cutand reddened with blood, as is said hereunder --"On the horn's face were thereAll the kin of lettersCut aright and reddened,How should I rede them rightly?The ling-fish longOf the land of Hadding,Wheat-ears unshorn,And wild things' inwards.In that beer were mingledMany ills together,Blood of all the woodAnd brown-burnt acorns,The black dew of the hearth,The God-doomed dead beast's inwards,And the swine's liver soddenBecause all wrongs that deadens.And so now, when their hearts are-brought anigh to each other,great cheer they made: then came Grimhild to Gudrun, and spake."All hail to thee, daughter!  I give thee gold and all kinds ofgood things to take to thee after thy father, dear bought ringsand bed-gear of the maids of the Huns, the most courteous andwell dight of all women; and thus is thy husband atoned for: andthereafter shalt thou be given to Atli, the mighty king, and bemistress of all his might.  Cast not all thy friends aside forone man's sake, but do according to our bidding."Gudrun answers, "Never will I wed Atli the King; unseemly it isfor us to get offspring betwixt us."Grimhild says, "Nourish not thy wrath; it shall be to thee as ifSigurd and Sigmund were alive when thou hast borne sons."Gudrun says, "I cannot take my heart from thoughts of him, for hewas the first of all men."Grimhild says, "So it is shapen that thou must have this king andnone else."Says Gudrun, "Give not this man to me, for an evil thing shallcome upon thy kin from him, and to his own sons shall he dealevil, and be rewarded with a grim revenge thereafter."Then waxed Grimhild fell at those words, and spake, "Do even aswe bid thee, and take therefore great honour, and our friendship,and the steads withal called Vinbjorg and Valbjorg."And such might was in the words of her, that even so must it cometo pass.Then Gudrun spake, "Thus then must it needs befall, howsoeveragainst the will of me, and for little joy shall it be and forgreat grief."Then men leaped on their horses, and their women were set inwains.  So they fared four days a-riding and other foura-shipboard, and yet four more again by land and road, till atthe last they came to a certain high-built hall; then came tomeet Gudrun many folk thronging; and an exceedingly goodly feastwas there made, even as the word had gone between either kin, andit passed forth in most proud and stately wise.  And at thatfeast drinks Atli his bridal with Gudrun, but never did her heartlaugh on him, and little sweet and kind was their life together.

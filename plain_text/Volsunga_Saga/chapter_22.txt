Now Sigurd rides away; many-folded is his shield, an blazing withred gold, and the image of a dragon is drawn thereon; and thissame was dark brown above, and bright red below; and with evensuch-like image was adorned helm, and saddle, and coat-armour;and he was clad in the golden byrny, and all his weapons weregold wrought.Now for this cause was the drake drawn on all his weapons, thatwhen he was seen of men, all folk might know who went there; yea,all those who had heard of his slaying of that great dragon, thatthe Voerings call Fafnir, and for that cause are his weaponsgold-wrought, and brown of hue, and that he was by far aboveother men in courtesy and goodly manners, and well-nigh in allthings else; and whenas folk tell of all the mightiest champions,and the noblest chiefs, then ever is he named the foremost, andhis name goes wide about on all tongues north of the sea of theGreek-lands, and even so shall it be while the world endures.Now the hair of this Sigurd was golden-red of hue, fair offashion, and falling down in great locks; thick and short was hisbeard, and of no other colour, high-nosed he was, broad and high-boned of face; so keen were his eyes, that few durst gaze upunder the brows of him; his shoulders were as broad to look on asthe shoulders of two; most duly was his body fashioned betwixtheight and breadth, and in such wise as was seemliest; and thisis the sign told of his height, that when he was girt with hissword Gram, which same was seven spans long, as he went throughthe full-grown rye-fields, the dew-shoe of the said sword smotethe ears of the standing corn; and, for all that, ;~greater washis strength than his growth: well could he wield sword, and castforth spear, shoot shaft, and hold shield, bend bow, back horse,and do all the goodly deeds that he learned in his youth's days. Wise he was to know things yet undone; and the voice of all fowlshe knew, wherefore few things fell on him unawares.Of many words he was and so fair of speech withal, thatwhensoever he made it his business to speak, he never leftspeaking before that to all men it seemed full sure, that nootherwise must the matter be than as he said.His sport and pleasure it was to give aid to his own folk, and toprove himself in mighty matters, to take wealth from hisunfriends, and give the same to his friends.Never did he lose heart, and of naught was he adrad.

Here begins the tale, and tells of a man who was named Sigi, andcalled of men the son of Odin; another man withal is told of inthe tale, hight Skadi, a great man and mighty of his hands; yetwas Sigi the mightier and the higher of kin, according to thespeech of men of that time.  Now Skadi had a thrall with whom thestory must deal somewhat, Bredi by name, who was called afterthat work which he had to do; in prowess and might of hand he wasequal to men who were held more worthy, yea, and better than somethereof.Now it is to be told that, on a time, Sigi fared to the huntingof the deer, and the thrall with him; and they hunted deer day-long till the evening; and when they gathered together their preyin the evening, lo, greater and more by far was that which Bredihad slain than Sigi's prey; and this thing he much misliked, andhe said that great wonder it was that a very thrall should out-dohim in the hunting of deer: so he fell on him and slew him, andburied the body of him thereafter in a snow-drift.Then he went home at evening tide and says that Bredi had riddenaway from him into the wild-wood.  "Soon was he out of my sight,"he says, "and naught more I wot of him."Skadi misdoubted the tale of Sigi, and deemed that this was aguile of his, and that he would have slain Bredi.  So he sent mento seek for him, and to such an end came their seeking, that theyfound him in a certain snow-drift; then said Skadi, that menshould call that snow-drift Bredi's Drift from henceforth; andthereafter have folk followed, so that in such wise they callevery drift that is right great.Thus it is well seen that Sigi has slain the thrall and murderedhim; so he is given forth to be a wolf in holy places, (1) andmay no more abide in the land with his father; therewith Odinbare him fellowship from the land, so long a way, that right longit was, and made no stay till he brought him to certain war-ships.  So Sigi falls to lying out a-warring with the strengththat his father gave him or ever they parted; and happy was he inhis warring, and ever prevailed, till he brought it about that hewon by his wars land and lordship at the last; and thereupon hetook to him a noble wife, and became a great and mighty king, andruled over the land of the Huns, and was the greatest ofwarriors.  He had a son by his wife, who was called Refit, whogrew up in his father's house, and soon became great of growth,and shapely.

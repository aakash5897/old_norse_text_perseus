The tale tells that Hjordis brought forth a man-child, who wasstraightly borne before King Hjalprek, and then was the king gladthereof, when he saw the keen eyes in the head of him, and hesaid that few men would be equal to him or like unto him in anywise.  So he was sprinkled with water, and had to name Sigurd, ofwhom all men speak with one speech and say that none was ever hislike for growth and goodliness.  He was brought up in the houseof King Hjalprek in great love and honour; and so it is, thatwhenso all the noblest men and greatest kings are named in theolden tales, Sigurd is ever put before them all for might andprowess, for high mind and stout heart; wherewith he was far moreabundantly gifted than any man of the northern parts of the wideworld.So Sigurd waxed in King Hjalprek's house, and there was no childbut loved him; through him was Hjordis betrothed to King Alf, andjointure meted to her.Now Sigurd's foster-father was hight Regin, the son of Hreidmar;he taught him all manner of arts, the chess play, and the lore ofrunes, and the talking of many tongues, even as the wont was withkings' sons in those days.  But on a day when they were together,Regin asked Sigurd, if he knew how much wealth his father hadowned, and who had the ward thereof; Sigurd answered, and saidthat the kings kept the ward thereof.Said Regin, "Dost thou trust them all utterly?"Sigurd said, "It is seemly that they keep it till I may dosomewhat therewith, for better they wot how to guard it than Ido."Another time came Regin to talk to Sigurd, and said --"A marvellous thing truly that thou must needs be a horse-boy tothe kings, and go about like a running knave.""Nay," said Sigurd, "it is not so, for in all things I have mywill, and whatso thing I desire is granted me with good will." "Well, then," said Regin, "ask for a horse of them.""Yea," quoth Sigurd, "and that shall I have, whenso I have needthereof."Thereafter Sigurd went to the king, and the king said --"What wilt thou have of us?"Then said Sigurd, "I would even a horse of thee for my disport."Then said the king, "Choose for thyself a horse, and whatso thingelse thou desirest among my matters."So the next day went Sigurd to the wood, and met on the way anold man, long-bearded, that he knew not, who asked him whitheraway.Sigurd said, "I am minded to choose me a horse; come thou, andcounsel me thereon.""Well then," said he, "go we and drive them to the river which iscalled Busil-tarn."They did so, and drave the horses down into the deeps of theriver, and all swam back to land but one horse; and that horseSigurd chose for himself; grey he was of hue, and young of years,great of growth, and fair to look on, nor had any man yet crossedhis back.Then spake the grey-beard, "From Sleipnir's kin is this horsecome, and he must be nourished heedfully, for it will be the bestof all horses;" and therewithal he vanished away.So Sigurd called the horse Grani, the best of all the horses ofthe world; nor was the man he met other than Odin himself.Now yet again spake Regin to Sigurd, and said --"Not enough is thy wealth, and I grieve right sore, that thoumust needs run here and there like s churl's son; but I can tellthee where there is much wealth for the winning, and great nameand honour to be won in getting of it."Sigurd asked where that might be, and who had watch and ward overit.Regin answered, "Fafnir is his name, and but a little way hencehe lies, on the waste of Gnita-heath; and when thou comest therethou mayst well say that thou hast never seen more gold heapedtogether in one place, and that none might desire more treasure,though he were the most ancient and famed of all kings.""Young am I," says Sigurd, "yet know I the fashion of this worm,and how that none durst go against him, so huge and evil is he." Regin said, "Nay it is not so, the fashion and the growth of himis even as of other lingworms, (1) and an over great tale menmake of it; and even so would thy forefathers have deemed; butthou, though thou be of the kin of the Volsungs, shalt scarcehave the heart and mind of those, who are told of as the first inall deeds of fame."Sigurd said, "Yea, belike I have little of their hardihood andprowess, but thou hast naught to do, to lay a coward's name uponme, when I am scarce out of my childish years.  Why dost thou eggme on hereto so busily?"Regin said, "Therein lies a tale which I must needs tell thee.""Let me hear the same," said Sigurd.

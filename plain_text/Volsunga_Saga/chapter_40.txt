Gudrun had a daughter by Sigurd hight Swanhild; she was thefairest of all women, eager-eyed as her father, so that few durstlook under the brows of her; and as far did she excel otherwoman-kind as the sun excels the other lights of heaven.But on a day went Gudrun down to the sea, and caught up stones inher arms, and went out into the sea, for she had will to end herlife.  But mighty billows drave her forth along the sea, and bymeans of their upholding was she borne along till she came at thelast to the burg of King Jonakr, a mighty king, and lord of manyfolk.  And he took Gudrun to wife, and their children wereHamdir, and Sorli, and Erp; and there was Swanhild nourishedwithal.

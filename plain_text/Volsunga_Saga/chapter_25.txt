There was a king hight Giuki, who ruled a realm south of theRhine; three sons he had, thus named: Gunnar, Hogni, and Guttorm,and Gudrun was the name of his daughter, the fairest of maidens;and all these children were far before all other king's childrenin all prowess, and in goodliness and growth withal; ever werehis sons at the wars and wrought many a deed of fame.  But Giukihad wedded Grimhild the Wise-wife.Now Budli was the name of a king mightier than Giuki, mightythough they both were: and Atli was the brother of Brynhild: Atliwas a fierce man and a grim, great and black to look on, yetnoble of mien withal, and the greatest of warriors.  Grimhild wasa fierce-heart woman.Now the days of the Giukings bloomed fair, and chiefly because ofthose children, so far before the sons of men.On a day Gudrun says to her mays that she may have no joy ofheart; then a certain woman asked her wherefore her joy wasdeparted.She answered, "Grief came to me in my dreams, therefore is theresorrow in my heart, since thou must needs ask thereof.""Tell it me, then, thy dream," said the woman, "for dreams oftforecast but the weather."Gudrun answers, "Nay, nay, no weather is this; I dreamed that Ihad a fair hawk on my wrist, feathered with feathers of gold." Says the woman, "Many have heard tell of thy beauty, thy wisdom,and thy courtesy; some king's son abides thee, then."Gudrun answers, "I dreamed that naught was so dear to me as thishawk, and all my wealth had I cast aside rather than him."The woman said, "Well, then, the man thou shalt have will be ofthe goodliest, and well shalt thou love him."Gudrun answered, "It grieves me that I know not who he shall be;let us go seek Brynhild, for she belike will wot thereof."So they arrayed them in gold and many a fair thing, and she wentwith her damsels till they came to the hall of Brynhild, and thathall was dight with gold, and stood on a high hill; and whenastheir goings were seen, it was told Brynhild, that a company ofwomen drove toward the burg in gilded waggons."That shall be Gudrun, Giuki's daughter," says she: "I dreamed ofher last night; let us go meet her!  No fairer woman may come toour house."So they went abroad to meet them, and gave them good greeting,and they went into the goodly hall together; fairly painted itwas within, and well adorned with silver vessel; cloths werespread under the feet of them, and all folk served them, and inmany wise they sported.But Gudrun was somewhat silent.Then said Brynhild, "Ill to abash folk of their mirth; prithee donot so; let us talk together for our disport of mighty kings andtheir great deeds.""Good talk," says Gudrun, "let us do even so; what kings deemestthou to have been the first of all men?"Brynhild says, "The sons of Haki, and Hagbard withal; theybrought to pass many a deed of fame in the warfare."Gudrun answers, "Great men certes, and of noble fame!  Yet Sigartook their one sister, and burned the other, house and all; andthey may be called slow to revenge the deed; why didst thou notname my brethren who are held to be the first of men as at thistime?"Brynhild says, "Men of good hope are they surely though butlittle proven hitherto; but one I know far before them, Sigurd,the son of Sigmund the king; a youngling was he in the days whenhe slew the sons of Hunding, and revenged his father, and Eylimi,his mother's father."Said Gudrun, "By what token tellest thou that?"Brynhild answered, "His mother went amid the dead and foundSigmund the king sore wounded, and would bind up his hurts; buthe said he grew over old for war; and bade her lay this comfortto her heart, that she should bear the most famed of sons; andwise was the wise man's word therein: for after the death of KingSigmund, she went to King Alf, and there was Sigurd nourished ingreat honour, and day by day he wrought some deed of fame, and isthe man most renowned of all the wide world."Gudrun says, "From love hast thou gained these tidings of him;but for this cause came I here, to tell thee dreams of mine whichhave brought me great grief."Says Brynhild, "Let not such matters sadden thee: abide with thyfriends who wish thee blithesome, all of them!""This I dreamed," said Gudrun, "that we went, a many of us incompany, from the bower, and we saw an exceeding great hart, thatfar excelled all other deer ever seen, and the hair of him wasgolden; and this deer we were all fain to take, but I alone gothim; and he seemed to me better than all things else; butsithence thou, Byrnhild, didst shoot and slay my deer even at myvery knees, and such grief was that to me that scarce might Ibear it; and then afterwards thou gavest me a wolf-cub, whichbesprinkled me with the blood of my brethren."Brynhild answers, "I will arede thy dream, even as things shallcome to pass hereafter; for Sigurd shall come to thee, even hewhom I have chosen for my well-beloved; and Grimhild shall givehim mead mingled with hurtful things, which shall cast us allinto mighty strife.  Him shalt thou have, and him shalt thouquickly miss; and Atli the king shalt thou wed; and thy brethrenshalt thou lose, and slay Atli withal in the end."Dudrun answers, "Grief and woe to know that such things shallbe!"And therewith she and hers get them gone home to King Giuki.

Now Gudrun heard of the slaying of Swanhild, and spake to hersons, "Why sit ye here in peace amid many words, whereasJormunrek hath slain your sister, and trodden her under foot ofhorses in shameful wise?  No heart ye have in you like to Gunnaror Hogni; verily they would have avenged their kinswoman!"Hamdir answered, "Little didst thou praise Gunnar and Hogni,whereas they slew Sigurd, and thou wert reddened in the blood ofhim, and ill were thy brethren avenged by the slaying of thineown sons: yet not so ill a deed were it for us to slay KingJormunrek, and so hard thou pushest on to this that we may naughtabide thy hard words."Gudrun went about laughing now, and gave them to drink frommighty beakers, and thereafter she got for them great byrnies andgood, and all other weed (1) of war.Then spake Hamdir, "Lo now, this is our last parting, for thoushalt hear tidings of us, and drink one grave-ale (2) over us andover Swanhild."So therewith they went their ways.But Gudrun went unto her bower, with heart swollen with sorrow,and spake --"To three men was I wedded, and first to Sigurd Fafnir's-bane,and he was bewrayed and slain, and of all griefs was that thegreatest grief.  Then was I given to King Atli, and so fell wasmy heart toward him that I slew in the fury of my grief hischildren and mine.  Then gave I myself to the sea, but thebillows thereof cast me out aland, and to this king then was Igiven; then gave I Swanhild away out of the land with mightywealth; and lo, my next greatest sorrow after Sigurd, for underhorses feet was she trodden and slain; but the grimmest andugliest of woes was the casting of Gunnar into the Worm-close,and the hardest was the cutting of Hogni's heart from him."Ah, better would it be if Sigurd came to meet me, and I went myways with him, for here bideth now behind with me neither son nordaughter to comfort me.  Oh, mindest thou not, Sigurd, the wordswe spoke when we went into one bed together, that thou wouldstcome and look on me; yea, even from thine abiding place among thedead?And thus had the words of her sorrow an end.

The tale tells that Sigmund thought Sinfjotli over young to helphim to his revenge, and will first of all harden him with manlydeeds; so in summer-tide they fare wide through the woods andslay men for their wealth; Sigmund deems him to take much afterthe kin of the Volsungs, though he thinks that he is Siggeir'sson, and deems him to have the evil heart of his father, with themight and daring of the Volsungs; withal he must needs think himin no wise a kinsome man, for full oft would he bring Sigmund'swrongs to his memory, and prick him on to slay King Siggeir.Now on a time as they fare abroad in the wood for the getting ofwealth, they find a certain house, and two men with great goldrings asleep therein: now these twain were spell-bound skin-changers, (1) and wolf-skins were hanging up over them in thehouse; and every tenth day might they come out of those skins;and they were kings' sons: so Sigmund and Sinfjofli do the wolf-skins on them, and then might they nowise come out of them,though forsooth the same nature went with them as heretofore;they howled as wolves howl but both knew the meaning of thathowling; they lay out in the wild-wood, and each went his way;and a word they made betwixt them, that they should risk theonset of seven men, but no more, and that he who was first to beset on should howl in wolfish wise: "Let us not depart fromthis," says Sigmund, "for thou art young and over-bold, and menwill deem the quarry good, when they take thee."Now each goes his way, and when they were parted, Sigmund meetscertain men, and gives forth a wolf's howl; and when Sinfjotliheard it, he went straightway thereto, and slew them all, andonce more they parted.  But ere Sinfjotli has fared long throughthe woods, eleven men meet him, and he wrought in such wise thathe slew them all, and was awearied therewith, and crawls under anoak, and there takes his rest.  Then came Sigmund thither, andsaid --"Why didst thou not call on me?"Sinfjotli said, "I was loth to call for thy help for the slayingof eleven men."Then Sigmund rushed at him so hard that he staggered and fell,and Sigmund bit him in the throat.  Now that day they might notcome out of their wolf-skins: but Sigmund lays the other on hisback, and bears him home to the house, and cursed the wolf-gearsand gave them to the trolls.  Now on a day he saw where twoweasels went and how that one bit the other in the throat, andthen ran straightway into the thicket, and took up a leaf andlaid in on the wound, and thereon his fellow sprang up quite andclean whole; so Sigmund went out and saw a raven flying with ablade of that same herb to him; so he took it and drew it overSinfjotli's hurt, and he straightway sprang up as whole as thoughhe had never been hurt.  There after they went home to theirearth-house, and abode there till the time came for them to putoff the wolf-shapes; then they burnt them up with fire, andprayed that no more hurt might come to any one from them; but inthat uncouth guise they wrought many famous deeds in the kingdomand lordship of King Siggeir.Now when Sinfjotli was come to man's estate, Sigmund deemed hehad tried him fully, and or ever a long time has gone by he turnshis mind to the avenging of his father; if so it may be broughtabout; so on s certain day the twain get them gone from theirearth-house, and come to the abode of King Siggeir late in theevening, and go into the porch before the hall, wherein were tunsof ale, and there they lie hid: now the queen is ware of them,where they are, and is fain to meet them; and when they met theytook counsel and were of one mind that Volsung should be revengedthat same night.Now Signy and the king had two children of tender age, who playedwith a golden toy on the floor, and bowled it along the pavementof the hall, running along with it; but therewith a golden ringfrom off it trundles away into the place where Sigmund andSinfjotli lay, and off runs the little one to search for thesame, and beholds withal where two men axe sitting, big andgrimly to look on, with overhanging helms and bright whitebyrnies; (2) so he runs up the hall to his father, and tells himof the sight he has seen, and thereat the king misdoubts of someguile abiding him; but Signy heard their speech, and arose andtook both the children, and went out into the porch to them andsaid --"Lo ye!  These younglings have bewrayed you; come now thereforeand slay them!"Sigmund says, "Never will I slay thy children for telling ofwhere I lay hid."But Sinfjotli made little enow of it, but drew his sword and slewthem both, and cast them into the hall at King 8iggeir's feet.Then up stood the king and cried on his men to take those who hadlain privily in the porch through the night.  So they ran thitherand would lay hands on them, but they stood on their defence welland manly, and long he remembered it who was the nighest to them;but in the end they were borne down by many men and taken, andbonds were set upon them, and they were cast into fetters whereinthey sit night long.Then the king ponders what longest and worst of deaths he shallmete out to them; and when morning came he let make a greatbarrow of stones and turf; and when it was done, let set a greatflat stone midmost inside thereof, so that one edge was aloft,the other alow; and so great it was that it went from wall towall, so that none might pass it.Now he bids folk take Sigmund and Sinfjotli and set them in thebarrow, on either side of the stone, for the worse for them hedeemed it, that they might hear each the other's speech, and yetthat neither might pass one to the other.  But now, while theywere covering in the barrow with the turf-slips, thither cameSigny, bearing straw with her, and cast it down to Sinfjotli, andbade the thralls hide this thing from the king; they said yeathereto, and therewithal was the barrow closed in.But when night fell, Sinfjotli said to Sigmund, "Belike we shallscarce need meat for a while, for here has the queen cast swine'sflesh into the barrow, and wrapped it round about on the outerside with straw."Therewith he handles the flesh and finds that therein was thrustSigmund's sword; and he knew it by the hilts as mirk as it mightbe in the barrow, and tells Sigmund thereof, and of that werethey both fain enow.Now Sinfjotli drave the point of the sword up into the big stone,and drew it hard along, and the sword bit on the stone.  Withthat Sigmund caught the sword by the point, and in this wise theysawed the stone between them, and let not or all the sawing wasdone that need be done, even as the song sings:"Sinfjotli sawedAnd Sigmund sawed,Atwain with mainThe stone was done."Now are they both together loose in the barrow, and soon they cutboth through stone and through iron, and bring themselves outthereof.  Then they go home to the hall, whenas all men sleptthere, and bear wood to the hall, and lay fire therein; andwithal the folk therein are waked by the smoke, and by the hallburning over their heads.Then the king cries out, "Who kindled this fire, I burn withal?" "Here am I," says Sigmund, "with Sinfjotli, my sister's son; andwe are minded that thou shalt wot well that all the Volsungs arenot yet dead."Then he bade his sister come out, and take all good things at hishands, and great honour, and fair atonement in that wise, for allher griefs.But she answered, "Take heed now, and consider, if I have keptKing Siggeir in memory, and his slaying of Volsung the king!  Ilet slay both my children, whom I deemed worthless for therevenging of our father, and I went into the wood to thee in awitch-wife's shape; and now behold, Sinfjotli is the son of theeand of me both!   And therefore has he this so great hardihoodand fierceness, in that he is the son both of Volsung's son andVolsung's daughter; and for this, and for naught else, have I sowrought, that Siggeir might get his bane at last; and all thesethings have I done that vengeance might fall on him, and that Itoo might not live long; and merrily now will I die with KingSiggeir, though I was naught merry to wed him."Therewith she kissed Sigmund her brother, and Sinfjotli, and wentback again into the fire, and there she died with King Siggeirand all his good men.But the two kinsmen gathered together folk and ships, and Sigmundwent back to his father's land, and drave away thence the king,who had set himself down there in the room of king Volsung.So Sigmund became a mighty King and far-famed, wise and high-minded: he had to wife one named Borghild, and two sons they hadbetween them, one named Helgi and the other Hamund; and whenHelgi was born, Norns came to him, (3) and spake over him, andsaid that he should be in time to come the most renowned of allkings.  Even therewith was Sigmund come home from the wars, andso therewith he gives him the name of Helgi, and these matters astokens thereof, Land of Rings, Sun-litten Hill and Sharp-shearingSword, and withal prayed that he might grow of great fame, andlike unto the kin of the Volsungs.And so it was that he grew up high-minded, and well beloved, andabove all other men in all prowess; and the story tells that hewent to the wars when he was fifteen winters old.  Helgi was lordand ruler over the army, but Sinfjotli was gotten to be hisfellow herein; the twain bare sway thereover.

Now King Atli eggs on his folk to set on fiercely, and eagerlythey fight; but the Giukings fell on so hard that King Atli gaveback into the hall, and within doors was the fight, and fiercebeyond all fights.That battle was the death of many a man, but such was the endingthereof, that there fell all the folk of those brethren, and theytwain alone stood up on their feet, and yet many more must fareto hell first before their weapons.And now they fell on Gunnar the king, and because of the host ofmen that set on him was hand laid on him, and he was cast intofetters; afterwards fought Hogni, with the stoutest heart and thegreatest manlihood; and he felled to earth twenty of the stoutestof the champions of King Atli, and many he thrust into the fire that burnt amidst the hall, and all were of one accord that sucha man might scarce be seen; yet in the end was he borne down bymany and taken.Then said King Atli, "A marvellous thing how many men have gonetheir ways before him!  Cut the heart from out of him, and letthat be his bane!"Hogni said, "Do according to thy will; merrily will I abidewhatso thou writ do against me; and thou shalt see that my heartis not adrad, for hard matters have I made trial of ere now, andall things that may try a man was I fain to bear, whiles yet Iwas unhurt; but now sorely am I hurt, and thou alone henceforthwill bear mastery in our dealings together."Then spake a counsellor of King Atli, "Better rede I see thereto;take we the thrall Hjalli, and give respite to Hogni; for thisthrall is made to die, since the longer he lives the less worthshall he be."The thrall hearkened, and cried out aloft, and fled awayanywhither where he might hope for shelter, crying out that ahard portion was his because of their strife and wild doings, andan ill day for him whereon he must be dragged to death from hissweet life and his swine-keeping.  But they caught him, andturned a knife against him, and he yelled and screamed or ever hefelt the point thereof.Then in such wise spake Hogni as a man seldom speaketh who isfallen into hard need, for he prayed for the thrall's life, andsaid that these shrieks he could not away with, and that it werea lesser matter to him to play out the play to the end; andtherewithal the thrall gat his life as for that time: but Gunnarand Hogni are both laid in fetters.Then spake King Atli with Gunnar the king, and bade him tell outconcerning the gold, and where it was, if he would have his life. But he answered, "Nay, first will I behold the bloody heart ofHogni, my brother."So now they caught hold of the thrall again, and cut the heartfrom out of him, and bore it unto King Gunnar, but he said --"The faint heart of Hjalli may ye here behold, little like theproud heart of Hogni, for as much as it trembleth now more by thehalf it trembled whenas it lay in the breast of him."So now they fell on Hogni even as Atli urged them, and cut theheart from out of him, but such was the might of his manhood,that he laughed while he abode that torment, and all wondered athis worth, and in perpetual memory is it held sithence. (1)Then they showed it to Gunnar, and he said --"The mighty heart of Hogni, little like the faint heart ofHjalli, for little as it trembleth now, less it trembled whenasin his breast it lay!  But now, O Atli, even as we die so shaltthou die; and lo, I alone wot where the gold is, nor shall Hognibe to tell thereof now; to and fro played the matter in my mindwhiles we both lived, but now have I myself determined formyself, and the Rhine river shall rule over the gold, rather thanthat the Huns shall bear it on the hands of them."Then said King Atli, "Have away the bondsman;" and so they did.But Gudrun called to her men, and came to Atli, and said --"May it fare ill with thee now and from henceforth, even as thouhast ill held to thy word with me!"So Gunnar was cast into a worm-close, and many worms abode himthere, and his hands were fast bound; but Gudrun sent him a harp,and in such wise did he set forth his craft, that wisely he smotethe harp, smiting it with his foes, and so excellently well heplayed, that few deemed they had heard such playing, even whenthe hand had done it.  And with such might and power he played,that all worms fell asleep in the end, save one adder only, greatand evil of aspect, that crept unto him and thrust its sting intohim until it smote his heart; and in such wise with greathardihood he ended his life days.

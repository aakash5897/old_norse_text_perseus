Now Sigurd and Regin ride up the heath along that same waywherein Fafnir was wont to creep when he fared to the water; andfolk say that thirty fathoms was the height of that cliff alongwhich he lay when he drank of the water below.  Then Sigurd spake--"How sayedst thou, Regin, that this drake (1) was no greater thanother lingworms; methinks the track of him is marvellous great?"Then said Regin, "Make thee a hole, and sit down therein, andwhenas the worm comes to the water, smite him into the heart, andso do him to death, and win thee great fame thereby."But Sigurd said, "What will betide me if I be before the blood ofthe worm?"Says Regin, "Of what avail to counsel thee if thou art stillafeard of everything?  Little art thou like thy kin in stoutnessof heart."Then Sigurd rides right over the heath; but Regin gets him gone,sore afeard.But Sigurd fell to digging him a pit, and whiles he was at thatwork, there came to him an old man with a long beard, and askedwhat he wrought there, and he told him.Then answered the old man and said, "Thou doest after sorrycounsel: rather dig thee many pits, and let the blood runtherein; but sit thee down in one thereof, and so thrust theworm's heart through."And therewithal he vanished away; but Sigurd made the pits evenas it was shown to him.Now crept the worm down to his place of watering, and the earthshook all about him, and he snorted forth venom on all the waybefore him as he went; but Sigurd neither trembled nor was adradat the roaring of him.  So whenas the worm crept over the pits,Sigurd thrust his sword under his left shoulder, so that it sankin up to the hilts; then up leapt Sigurd from the pit and drewthe sword back again unto him, and therewith was his arm allbloody, up to the very shoulder.Now when that mighty worm was ware that he had his death-wound,then he lashed out head and tail, so that all things soever thatwere before him were broken to pieces.So whenas Fafnir had his death-wound, he asked "Who art thou? And who is thy father?  And what thy kin, that thou wert so hardyas to bear weapons against me?"Sigurd answered, "Unknown to men is my kin.  I am called a noblebeast: (2) neither father have I nor mother, and all alone have Ifared hither."Said Fafnir, "Whereas thou hast neither father nor mother, ofwhat wonder weft thou born then?  But now, though thou tellest menot thy name on this my death-day, yet thou knowest verily thatthou liest unto me."He answered, "Sigurd am I called, and my father was Sigmund." Says Fafnir, "Who egged thee on to this deed, and why wouldstthou be driven to it?  Hadst thou never heard how that all folkwere adrad of me, and of the awe of my countenance?  But an eagerfather thou hadst, O bright eyed swain!"Sigurd answered, "A hardy heart urged me on hereto, and a stronghand and this sharp sword, which well thou knowest now, stood mein stead in the doing of the deed.  `Seldom hath hardy eld afaint-heart youth.'"Fafnir said, "Well, I wot that hadst thou waxed amid thy kin,thou mightest have good skill to slay folk in thine anger; butmore of a marvel is it, that thou, a bondsman taken in war,shouldst have the heart to set on me, `for few among bondsmenhave heart for the fight.'"Said 8igurd, "Wilt thou then cast it in my teeth that I am faraway from my kin?  Albeit I was a bondsman, yet was I nevershackled.  God wot thou hast found me free enow."Fafnir answered, "In angry wise dost thou take my speech; buthearken, for that same gold which I have owned shall be thy banetoo."Quoth Sigurd, "Fain would we keep all our wealth til that day ofdays; yet shall each man die once for all."Said Fafnir, "Few things wilt thou do after my counsel, but takeheed that thou shalt be drowned if thou farest unwarily over thesea; so bide thou rather on the dry land for the coming of thecalm tide."Then said Sigurd, "Speak, Fafnir, and say, if thou art soexceeding wise, who are the Norns who rule the lot of allmothers' sons."Fafnir answers, "Many there be and wide apart; for some are ofthe kin of the Aesir, and some are of Elfin kin, and some thereare who are daughters of Dvalin."Said Sigurd, "How namest thou the holm whereon Surt (3) and theAesir mix and mingle the water of the sword?""Unshapen is that holm hight," said Fafnir.And yet again he said, "Regin, my brother, has brought about myend, and it gladdens my heart that thine too he bringeth about;for thus will things be according to his will."And once again he spake, "A countenance of terror I bore upbefore all folk, after that I brooded over the heritage of mybrother, and on every side did I spout out poison, so that nonedurst come anigh me, and of no weapon was I adrad, nor ever had Iso many men before me, as that I deemed myself not stronger thanall; for all men were sore afeard of me."Sigurd answered and said, "Few may have victory by means of thatsame countenance of terror, for whoso comes amongst many shallone day find that no one man is by so far the mightiest of all." Then says Fafnir, "Such counsel I give thee, that thou take thyhorse and ride away at thy speediest, for ofttimes it fails outso, that he who gets a death-wound avenges himself none theless."Sigurd answered, "Such as thy redes are I will nowise do afterthem; nay, I will ride now to thy lair and take to me that greattreasure of thy kin.""Ride there then," said Fafnir, "and thou shalt find gold enow tosuffice thee for all thy life-days; yet shall that gold be thybane, and the bane of every one soever who owns it."Then up stood Sigurd, and said, "Home would I ride and lose allthat wealth, if I deemed that by the losing thereof I shouldnever die; but every brave and true man will fain have his handon wealth till that last day that thou, Fafnir, wallow in thedeath-pain til Death and Hell have thee."And therewithal Fafnir died.

Jormunrek was the name of a mighty king of those days, and hisson was called Randver.  Now this king called his son to talkwith him, and said, "Thou shalt fair on an errand of mine to KingJonakr, with my counsellor Bikki, for with King Jonakr isnourished Swanhild, the daughter of Sigurd Fafnir's-bane; and Iknow for sure that she is the fairest may dwelling under the sunof this world; her above all others would I have to my wife, andthou shalt go woo her for me"Randver answered, "Meet and right, fair lord, that I should go onthine errands."So the king set forth this journey in seemly wise, and they faretill they come to King Jonakr's abode, and behold Swanhild, andhave many thoughts concerning the treasure of her goodliness.But on a day Randver called the king to talk with him, and said,"Jormunrek the King would fain be thy brother-in-law, for he hasheard tell of Swanhild, and his desire it is to have her to wife,nor may it be shown that she may be given to any mightier manthan he is one."The King says, "This is an alliance of great honour, for a man offame he is."Gudrun says, "A wavering trust, the trust in luck that changenot!"Yet because of the king's furthering, and all the matters thatwent herewith, is the wooing accomplished; and Swanhild went tothe ship with a goodly company, and sat in the stem beside theking's son.Then spake Bikki to Randver, "How good and right it were if thouthyself had to wife so lovely a woman rather than the old manthere."Good seemed that word to the heart of the king's son, and hespake to her with sweet words, and she to him like wise.So they came aland and go unto the king, and Bikki said to him,"Meet and right it is, lord, that thou shouldst know what isbefallen, though hard it be to tell of, for the tale must beconcerning thy beguiling, whereas thy son has gotten to him thefull love of Swanhild, nor is she other than his harlot; butthou, let not the deed be unavenged."Now many an ill rede had he given the king or this, but of allhis ill redes did this sting home the most; and still would theking hearken to all his evil redes; wherefore he, who mightnowise still the wrath within him, cried out that Randver shouldbe taken and tied up to the gallows-tree.And as he was led to the gallows he took his hawk and plucked thefeathers from off it, and bade show it to his father; and whenthe king saw it, then he said, "Now may folk behold that hedeemeth my honour to be gone away from me, even as the feathersof this hawk;" and therewith he bade deliver him from thegallows.But in that while had Bikki wrought his will, and Randver wasdead-slain.Ane, moreover, Bikki spake, "Against none hast thou more wrongsto avenge thee of than against Swanhild; let her die a shamefuldeath.""Yea," said the king, "we will do after thy counsel."So she was bound in the gate of the burg, and horse were drivenat her to tread her down; but when she opened her eyes wide, thenthe horses durst not trample her; so when Bikki beheld that, hebade draw a bag over the head of her; and they did so, andtherewith she lost her life.

Now the tale tells that Helgi in his warring met a king hightHunding, a mighty king, and lord of many men and many lands; theyfell to battle together, and Helgi went forth mightily, and suchwas the end of that fight that Helgi had the victory, but KingHunding fell and many of his men with him; but Helgi is deemed tohave grown greatly in fame because he had slain so mighty a king. Then the sons of Hunding draw together a great army to avengetheir father.  Hard was the fight betwixt them; but Helgi goesthrough the folk of those brothers unto their banner, and thereslays these sons of Hunding, Alf and Eyolf, Herward and Hagbard,and wins there a great victory.Now as Helgi fared from the fight he met a many women right fairand worthy to look on, who rode in exceeding noble array; but onefar excelled them all; then Helgi asked them the name of thattheir lady and queen, and she named herself Sigrun, and said shewas daughter of King Hogni.Then said Helgi, "Fare home with us: good welcome shall ye have!"Then said the king's daughter, "Other work lies before us than todrink with thee.""Yea, and what work, king's daughter?" said Helgi.She answers, "King Hogni has promised me to Hodbrod, the son ofKing Granmar, but I have vowed a vow that I will have him to myhusband no more than if he were a crow's son and not a king's;and yet will the thing come to pass, but and if thou standest inthe way thereof and goest against him with an army, and takest meaway withal; for verily with no king would I rather bide onbolster than with thee.""Be of good cheer, king's daughter," says he, "for certes he andI shall try the matter, or ever thou be given to him; yea, weshall behold which may prevail against the other; and hereto Ipledge my life."Thereafter, Helgi sent men with money in their hand to summon hisfolk to him, and all his power is called together to Red-Berg:and there Helgi abode till such time as a great company came tohim from Hedinsey; and therewithal came mighty power from NorviSound aboard great and fair ships.  Then King Helgi called to himthe captain of his ships, who was hight Leif, and asked him if hehad told over the tale of his army."A thing not easy to tell, lord," says he, "on the ships thatcame out of Norvi Sound are twelve thousand men, and otherwhereare half as many again."Then bade King Helgi turn into the firth, called Varin's firth,and they did so: but now there fell on them so fierce a storm andso huge a sea, that the beat of the waves on board and bow was tohearken to like as the clashing together of high hills broken. But Helgi bade men fear naught, nor take in any sail, but ratherhoist every rag higher than heretofore; but little did they missof foundering or ever they made land; then came Sigrun, daughterof King Hogni, down on to the beach with a great army, and turnedthem away thence to a good haven called Gnipalund; but thelandsmen see what has befallen and come down to the sea-shore.The brother of King Hodbrod, lord of a land called Swarin'sCairn, cried out to them, and asked them who was captain overthat mighty army.  Then up stands Sinfjotli, with a helm on hishead, bright shining as glass, and a byrny as white as snow; aspear in his hand, and thereon a banner of renown, and a gold-rimmed shield hanging before him; and well he knew with whatwords to speak to kings --"Go thou and say, when thou hast made an end of feeding thy swineand thy dogs, and when thou beholdest thy wife again, that hereare come the Volsungs, and in this company may King Helgi befound, if Hodbrod be fain of finding him, for his game and hisjoy it is to fight and win fame, while thou art kissing thehandmaids by the fire-side."Then answered Granmar, "In nowise knowest thou how to speakseemly things, and to tell of matters remembered from of old,whereas thou layest lies on chiefs and lords; most like it isthat thou must have long been nourished with wolf-meat abroad inthe wild-woods, and has slain thy brethren; and a marvel it is tobehold that thou darest to join thyself to the company of goodmen and true, thou, who hast sucked the blood of many a coldcorpse."Sinfjotli answered, "Dim belike is grown thy memory now, of howthou wert a witch-wife on Varinsey, and wouldst fain have a manto thee, and chose me to that same office of all the world; andhow thereafter thou wert a Valkyria (1) in Asgarth, and it well-nigh came to this, that for thy sweet sake should all men fight;and nine wolf whelps I begat on thy body in Lowness, and was thefather to them all."Granmar answers, "Great skill of lying hast thou; yet belike thefather of naught at all mayst thou be, since thou wert gelded bythe giant's daughters of Thrasness; and lo thou art the stepsonof King Siggeir, and were wont to lie abroad in wilds and woodswith the kin of wolves; and unlucky was the hand wherewith thouslewest thy brethren making for thyself an exceeding evil name."Said Sinfjotli, "Mindest thou not then, when thou were stallionGrani's mare, and how I rode thee an amble on Bravoli, and thatafterwards thou wert giant Golnir's goat herd?"Granmar says, "Rather would I feed fowls with the flesh of theethan wrangle any longer with thee."Then spake King Helgi, "Better were it for ye, and a more manlydeed, to fight, rather than to speak such things as it is a shameeven to hearken to; Granmar's sons are no friends of me and ofmine, yet are they hardy men none the less."So Granmar rode away to meet King Hodbrod, at a stead calledSunfells, and the horses of the twain were named Sveipud andSveggjud.  The brothers met in the castle-porch, and Granmar toldHodbrod of the war-news.  King Hodbrod was clad in a byrny, andhad his helm on his head; he asked --"What men are anigh, why look ye so wrathful?"Granmar says, "Here are come the Volsungs, and twelve thousandmen of them are afloat off the coast, and seven thousand are atthe island called Sok, but at the stead called Grindur is thegreatest company of all, and now I deem withal that Helgi and hisfellowship have good will to give battle."Then said the king, "Let us send a message through all our realm,and go against them, neither let any who is fain of fight sitidle at home; let us send word to the sons of Ring, and to KingHogni, and to Alf the Old, for they are mighty warriors."So the hosts met at Wolfstone, and fierce fight befell there;Helgi rushed forth through the host of his foes, and many a manfell there; at last folk saw a great company of shield-maidens,like burning flames to look on, and there was come Sigrun, theking's daughter.  Then King Helgi fell on King Hodbrod, and smotehim, and slew him even under his very banner; and Sigrun criedout --"Have thou thanks for thy so manly deed!  Now shall we share theland between us, and a day of great good hap this is to me, andfor this deed shalt thou get honour and renown, in that thou hastfelled to earth so mighty a king."So Helgi took to him that realm and dwelt there long, when he hadwedded Sigrun, and became a king of great honour and renown,though he has naught more to do with this story.

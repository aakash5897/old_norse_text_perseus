In offering to the reader this translation of the most completeand dramatic form of the great Epic of the North, we lay no claimto special critical insight, nor do we care to deal at all withvexed questions, but are content to abide by existingauthorities, doing our utmost to make our rendering close andaccurate, and, if it might be so, at the same time, not overprosaic: it is to the lover of poetry and nature, rather than tothe student, that we appeal to enjoy and wonder at this greatwork, now for the first time, strange to say, translated intoEnglish: this must be our excuse for speaking here, as briefly asmay be, of things that will seem to the student over well knownto be worth mentioning, but which may give some ease to thegeneral reader who comes across our book.The prose of the "Volsunga Saga" was composed probably some timein the twelfth century, from floating traditions no doubt; fromsongs which, now lost, were then known, at least in fragments, tothe Sagaman; and finally from songs, which, written down abouthis time, are still existing: the greater part of these last thereader will find in this book, some inserted amongst the prosetext by the original story-teller, and some by the presenttranslators, and the remainder in the latter part of the book,put together as nearly as may be in the order of the story, andforming a metrical version of the greater portion of it.These Songs from the Elder Edda we will now briefly compare withthe prose of the Volsung Story, premising that these are the onlymetrical sources existing of those from which the Sagaman toldhis tale.Except for the short snatch on p. 24 (1) of our translation,nothing is now left of these till we come to the episode of HelgiHundings-bane, Sigurd's half-brother; there are two songs leftrelating to this, from which the prose is put together; to acertain extent they cover the same ground; but the latter half ofthe second is, wisely as we think, left untouched by the Sagaman,as its interest is of itself too great not to encumber theprogress of the main story; for the sake of its wonderful beauty,however, we could not refrain from rendering it, and it will befound first among the metrical translations that form the secondpart of this book.Of the next part of the Saga, the deaths of Sinfjotli andSigmund, and the journey of Queen Hjordis to the court of KingAlf, there is no trace left of any metrical origin; but we meetthe Edda once more where Regin tells the tale of his kin toSigurd, and where Sigurd defeats and slays the sons of Hunding:this lay is known as the "Lay of Regin".The short chap. xvi. is abbreviated from a long poem called the"Prophecy of Gripir" (the Grifir of the Saga), where the wholestory to come is told with some detail, and which certainly, ifdrawn out at length into the prose, would have forestalled theinterest of the tale.In the slaying of the Dragon the Saga adheres very closely to the"Lay of Fafnir"; for the insertion of the song of the birds toSigurd the present translators are responsible.Then comes the waking of Brynhild, and her wise redes to Sigurd,taken from the Lay of Sigrdrifa, the greater part of which, inits metrical form, is inserted by the Sagaman into his prose; butthe stanza relating Brynhild's awaking we have inserted into thetext; the latter part, omitted in the prose, we have translatedfor the second part of our book.Of Sigurd at Hlymdale, of Gudrun's dream, the magic potion ofGrimhild, the wedding of Sigurd consequent on that potion; of thewooing of Brynhild for Gunnar, her marriage to him, of thequarrel of the Queens, the brooding grief and wrath of Brynhild,and the interview of Sigurd with her -- of all this, the mostdramatic and best-considered parts of the tale, there is now nomore left that retains its metrical form than the few snatchespreserved by the Sagaman, though many of the incidents arealluded to in other poems.Chap. xxx. is met by the poem called the "Short Lay of Sigurd",which, fragmentary apparently at the beginning, gives ussomething of Brynhild's awakening wrath and jealousy, the slayingof Sigurd, and the death of Brynhild herself; this poem we havetranslated entire.The Fragments of the "Lay of Brynhild" are what is left of a poempartly covering the same ground as this last, but giving adifferent account of Sigurd's slaying; it is very incomplete,though the Sagaman has drawn some incidents from it; the readerwill find it translated in our second part.But before the death of the heroine we have inserted entire intothe text as chap. xxxi. the "First Lay of Gudrun", the mostlyrical, the most complete, and the most beautiful of all theEddaic poems; a poem that any age or language might count amongits most precious possessions.From this point to the end of the Saga it keeps closely to theSongs of Edda; in chap. xxxii. the Sagaman has rendered intoprose the "Ancient Lay of Gudrun", except for the beginning,which gives again another account of the death of Sigurd: thislay also we have translated.The grand poem, called the "Hell-ride of Brynhild", is notrepresented directly by anything in the prose except that theSagaman has supplied from it a link or two wanting in the "Lay ofSigrdrifa"; it will be found translated in our second part.The betrayal and slaughter of the Giukings or Niblungs, and thefearful end of Atli and his sons, and court, are recounted in twolays, called the "Lays of Atli"; the longest of these, the"Greenland Lay of Atli", is followed closely by the Sagaman; theShorter one we have translated.The end of Gudrun, of her daughter by Sigurd and of her sons byher last husband Jonakr, treated of in the last four chapters ofthe Saga, are very grandly and poetically given in the songscalled the "Whetting of Gudrun", and the "Lay of Hamdir", whichare also among our translations.These are all the songs of the Edda which the Sagaman has dealtwith; but one other, the "Lament of Oddrun", we have translatedon account of its intrinsic merit.As to the literary quality of this work we in say much, but wethink we may well trust the reader of poetic insight to breakthrough whatever entanglement of strange manners or unusedelement may at first trouble him, and to meet the nature andbeauty with which it is filled: we cannot doubt that such areader will be intensely touched by finding, amidst all itswildness and remoteness, such a startling realism, such subtilty,such close sympathy with all the passions that may move himselfto-day.In conclusion, we must again say how strange it seems to us, thatthis Volsung Tale, which is in fact an unversified poem, shouldnever before been translated into English.  For this is the GreatStory of the North, which should be to all our race what the Taleof Troy was to the Greeks -- to all our race first, andafterwards, when the change of the world has made our racenothing more than a name of what has been -- a story too -- thenshould it be to those that come after us no less than the Tale ofTroy has been to us.WILLIAM MORRIS and EIRIKR MAGNUSSON.

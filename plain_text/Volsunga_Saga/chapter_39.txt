Now thought Atli the King that he had gained a mighty victory,and spake to Gudrun even as mocking her greatly, or as makinghimself great before her.  "Gudrun," saith he, "thus hast thoulost thy brethren, and thy very self hast brought it about."She answers, "In good liking livest thou, whereas thou thrustestthese slayings before me, but mayhappen thou wilt rue it, whenthou hast tried what is to come hereafter; and of all I have, thelongest-lived matter shall be the memory of thy cruel heart, norshall it go well with thee whiles I live."He answered and said, "Let there be peace betwixt us; I willatone for thy brethren with gold and dear-bought things, even asthy heart may wish."She answers, "Hard for a long while have I been in our dealingstogether, and now I say, that while Hogni was yet alive thoumightest have brought it to pass; but now mayest thou never atonefor my brethren in my heart; yet oft must we women be overborneby the might of you men; and now are all my kindred dead andgone, and thou alone art left to rule over me: wherefore now thisis my counsel that we make a great feast; wherein I will hold thefuneral of my brother and of thy kindred withal."In such wise did she make herself soft and kind in words, thoughfar other things forsooth lay thereunder, but he hearkened to hergladly, and trusted in her words, whereas she made herself sweetof speech.So Gudrun held the funeral feast for her brethren, and King Atlifor his men, and exceeding proud and great was this feast.But Gudrun forgat not her woe, but brooded over it, how she mightwork some mighty shame against the king; and at nightfall shetook to her the sons of King Atli and her as they played aboutthe floor; the younglings waxed heavy of cheer, and asked whatshe would with them."Ask me not," she said; "ye shall die, the twain of you!"Then they answered, "Thou mayest do with thy children even asthou wilt, nor shall any hinder thee, but shame there is to theein the doing of this deed."Yet for all that she cut the throats of them.Then the king asked where his sons were, and Gudrun answered, "Iwill tell thee, and gladden thine heart by the telling; lo now,thou didst make a great woe spring up for me in the slaying of mybrethren; now hearken and hear my rede and my deed; thou hastlost thy sons, and their heads are become beakers on the boardhere, and thou thyself hast drunken the blood of them blendedwith wine; and their hearts I took and roasted them on a spit,and thou hast eaten thereof."King Atli answered, "Grim art thou in that thou hast murdered thysons, and given me their flesh to eat, and little space passesbetwixt ill deed of thine and ill deed."Gudrun said, "My heart is set on the doing to thee of as greatshame as may be; never shall the measure ill be of full to such aking as thou art."The king said, "Worser deeds hast thou done than men have to tellof, and great unwisdom is there in such fearful redes; most meetart thou to be burned on bale when thou hast first been smittento death with stones, for in such wise wouldst thou have whatthou hast gone a weary way to seek."She answered, "Thine own death thou foretellest, but anotherdeath is fated for me."And many other words they spake in their wrath.Now Hogni had a son left alive, hight Niblung, and great wrath ofheart he bare against King Atli; and he did Gudrun to wit that hewould avenge his father.  And she took his words well, and theyfell to counsel together thereover, and she said it would begreat goodhap if it might be brought about.So on a night, when the king had drunken, he gat him in bed, andwhen he was laid asleep, thither to him came Gudrun and the sonof Hogni.Gudrun took a sword and thrust it through the breast of KingAtli, and they both of them set their hands to the deed, both sheand the son of Hogni.Then Atli the king awoke with the wound, and cried out; "No needof binding or salving here! -- who art thou who hast done thedeed?"Gudrun says, "Somewhat have I, Gudrun, wrought therein, andsomewhat withal the son of Hogni."Atli said, "Ill it beseemed to thee to do this, though somewhatof wrong was between us; for thou wert wedded to me by the redeof thy kin, and dower paid I for thee; yea, thirty goodlyknights, and seemly maidens, and many men besides; and yet wertthou not content, but if thou should rule over the lands KingBudli owned: and thy mother-in-law full oft thou lettest sita-weeping."Gudrun said, "Many false words hast thou spoken, and of naught Iaccount them; oft, indeed, was I fell of mood, but much didstthou add thereto.  Full oft in this thy house did frays befall,and kin fought kin, and friend fought friend, and made themselvesbig one against the other; better days had I whenas I abode withSigurd, when we slew kings, and took their wealth to us, but gavepeace to whomso would, and the great men laid themselves underour hands, and might we gave to him of them who would have it;then I lost him, and a little thing was it that I should bear awidow's name, but the greatest of griefs that I should come tothee -- I who had aforetime the noblest of all kings, while forthee, thou never barest out of the battle aught but the worserlot."King Atli answered, "Naught true are thy words, nor will this ourspeech better the lot of either of us, for all is fallen now tonaught; but now do to me in seemly wise, and array my dead corpsein noble fashion.""Yea, that will I," she says, "and let make for thee a goodlygrave, and build for thee a worthy abiding place of stone, andwrap thee in fair linen, and care for all that needful is."So therewithal he died, and she did according to her word: andthen they cast fire into the hall.And when the folk and men of estate awoke amid that dread andtrouble, naught would they abide the fire, but smote each theother down, and died in such wise; so there Atli the king, andall his folk, ended their life-days.  But Gudrun had no will tolive longer after this deed so wrought, but nevertheless herending day was not yet come upon her.Now the Volsungs and the Giukings, as folk tell in tale, havebeen the greatest-hearted and the mightiest of all men, as ye maywell behold written in the songs of old time.But now with the tidings just told were these troubles stayed.

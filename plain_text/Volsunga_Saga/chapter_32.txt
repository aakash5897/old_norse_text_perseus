And now none might know for what cause Brynhild must bewail withweeping for what she had prayed for with laughter: but she spake--"Such a dream I had, Gunnar, as that my bed was acold, and thatthou didst ride into the hands of thy foes: lo now, ill shall itgo with thee and all thy kin, O ye breakers of oaths; for on theday thou slayedst him, dimly didst thou remember how thou didstblend thy blood with the blood of Sigurd, and with an ill rewardhast thou rewarded him for all that he did well to thee; whereashe gave unto thee to be the mightiest of men; and well was itproven how fast he held to his oath sworn, when he came to me andlaid betwixt us the sharp-edged sword that in venom had been madehard.  All too soon did ye fall to working wrong against him andagainst me, whenas I abode at home with my father, and had allthat I would, and had no will that any one of you should be anyof mine, as ye rode into our garth, ye three kings together; butthen Atli led me apart privily, and asked me if I would not havehim who rode Grani;   yea, a man nowise like unto you; but inthose days I plighted myself to the son of King Sigmund and noother; and lo, now, no better shall ye fare for the death of me."Then rose up Gunnar, and laid his arms about her neck, andbesought her to live and have wealth from him; and all others inlikewise letted her from dying; but she thrust them all from her,and said that it was not the part of any to let her in that whichwas her will.Then Gunnar called to Hogni, and prayed him for counsel, and badehim go to her, and see if he might perchance soften her dreadfulheart, saying withal, that now they had need enough on theirhands in the slaking of her grief, till time might get over.But Hogni answered, "Nay, let no man hinder her from dying; forno gain will she be to us, nor has she been gainsome since shecame hither!Now she bade bring forth much gold, and bade all those comethither who would have wealth: then she caught up a sword, andthrust it under her armpit, and sank aside upon the pillows, andsaid, "Come, take gold whoso will!"But all held their peace, and she said, "Take the gold, and beglad thereof!"And therewith she spake unto Gunnar, "Now for a little while willI tell of that which shall come to pass hereafter; for speedilyshall ye be at one again with Gudrun by the rede of Grimhild theWise-wife; and the daughter of Gudrun and Sigurd shall be calledSwanhild, the fairest of all women born.  Gudrun shall be givento Atli, yet not with her good will.  Thou shalt be fain to getOddrun, but that shall Atli forbid thee; but privily shall yemeet, and much shall she love thee.  Atli shall bewray thee, andcast thee into a worm-close, and thereafter shall Atli and hisSons be slain, and Gudrun shall be their slayer; and afterwardsshall the great waves bear her to the burg of King Jonakr, towhom she shall bear sons of great fame: Swanhild shall be sentfrom the land and given to King Jormunrek; and her shall bite therede of Bikki, and therewithal is the kin of you clean gone; andmore sorrow therewith for Gudrun."And now I pray thee, Gunnar, one last boon. -- Let make a greatbale on the plain meads for all of us; for me and for Sigurd, andfor those who were slain with him, and let that be covered overwith cloth dyed red by the folk of the Gauls, (1) and burn methereon on one side of the King of the Huns, and on the otherthose men of mine, two at the head and two at the feet, and twohawks withal; and even so is all shared equally; and lay therebetwixt us a drawn sword, as in the other days when we twainstepped into one bed together; and then may we have the name ofman and wife, nor shall the door swing to at the heel of him as Igo behind him.  Nor shall that be a niggard company if therefollow him those five bond-women and eight bondmen, whom myfather gave me, and those burn there withal who were slain withSigurd."Now more yet would I say, but for my wounds, but my life-breathflits; the wounds open, -- yet have I said sooth."Now is the dead corpse of Sigurd arrayed in olden wise, and amighty bale is raised, and when it was somewhat kindled, therewas laid thereon the dead corpse of Sigurd Fafnir's-bane, and hisson of three winters whom Brynhild had let slay, and Guttormwithal; and when the bale was all ablaze, thereunto was Brynhildborne out, when she had spoken with her bower-maidens, and bidthem take the gold that she would give; and then died Brynhild,and was burned there by the side of Sigurd, and thus their life-days ended.

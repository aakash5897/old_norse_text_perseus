On a day as the Queens went to the river to bathe them, Brynhildwaded the farthest out into the river; then asked Gudrun whatthat deed might signify.Brynhild said, "Yea, and why then should I be equal to thee inthis matter more than in others?  I am minded to think that myfather is mightier than thine, and my true love has wrought manywondrous works of fame, and hath ridden the flaming fire withal,while thy husband was but the thrall of King Hjalprek."Gudrun answered full of wrath, "Thou wouldst be wise if thoushouldst hold thy peace rather than revile my husband: lo now,the talk of all men it is, that none has ever abode in this worldlike unto him in all matters soever; and little it beseems theeof all folk to mock him who was thy first beloved: and Fafnir heslew, yea, and he rode thy flaming fire, whereas thou didst deemthat he was Gunnar the King, and by thy side he lay, and tookfrom thine hand the ring Andvari's-loom; -- here mayst thou wellbehold it!"Then Brynhild saw the ring and knew it, and waxed as wan as adead woman, and she went home and spake no word the evening long.So when Sigurd came to bed to Gudrun she asked him why Brynhild'sjoy was so departed.He answered, "I know not, but sore I misdoubt me that soon weshall know thereof overwell."Gudrun said, "Why may she not love her life, having wealth andbliss, and the praise of all men, and the man withal that shewould have?""Ah, yea!" said Sigurd, "and where in all the world was she then,when she said that she deemed she had the noblest of all men, andthe dearest to her heart of all?"Gudrun answers, "Tomorn will I ask her concerning this, who isthe liefest to her of all men for a husband."Sigurd said, "Needs must I forbid thee this, and full surely wiltthou rue the deed if thou doest it."Now the next morning they sat in the bower, and Brynhild wassilent; then spake Gudrun --"Be merry, Brynhild!  Grievest thou because of that speech ofours together, or what other thing slayeth thy bliss?"Brynhild answers, "With naught but evil intent thou sayest this,for a cruel heart thou hast.""Say not so," said Gudrun; "but rather tell me all the tale."Brynhild answers, "Ask such things only as are good for thee toknow -- matters meet for mighty dames.  Good to love good thingswhen all goes according to thy heart's desire!"Gudrun says, "Early days for me to glory in that; but this wordof thine looketh toward some foreseeing.  What ill dost thouthrust at us?  I did naught to grieve thee."Brynhild answers, "For this shalt thou pay, in that thou hast gotSigurd to thee, -- nowise can I see thee living in the blissthereof, whereas thou hast him, and the wealth and the might ofhim."But Gudrun answered, "Naught knew I of your words and vowstogether; and well might my father look to the mating of mewithout dealing with thee first.""No secret speech had we," quoth Brynhild, "though we swore oathtogether; and full well didst thou know that thou wentest aboutto beguile me; verily thou shalt have thy reward!"Says Gudrun, "Thou art mated better than thou are worthy of; butthy pride and rage shall be hard to slake belike, and there forshall many a man pay.""Ah, I should be well content," said Brynhild, "if thou hadst notthe nobler man!"Gudrun answers, "So noble a husband hast thou, that who knows ofa greater king or a lord of more wealth and might?"Says Brynhild, "Sigurd slew Fafnir, and that only deed is of moreworth than all the might of King Gunnar."(Even as the song says) --"The worm Sigurd slew,Nor ere shall that deedBe worsened by ageWhile the world is alive.But thy brother the KingNever durst, never boreThe flame to ride downThrough the fire to fare."Gudrun answers, "Grani would not abide the fire under Gunnar theKing, but Sigurd durst the deed, and thy heart may well abidewithout mocking him."Brynhild answers, "Nowise will I hide from thee that I deem nogood of Grimhild."Says Gudrun, "Nay, lay no ill words on her, for in all things sheis to thee as to her own daughter.""Ah," says Brynhild, "she is the beginning of all this hale thatbiteth so; an evil drink she bare to Sigurd, so that he had nomore memory of my very name.""All wrong thou talkest; a lie without measure is this," quothGudrun.Brynhild answered, "Have thou joy of Sigurd according to themeasure of the wiles wherewith ye have beguiled me!  Unworthilyhave ye conspired against me; may all things go with you as myheart hopes!"Gudrun says, "More joy shall I have of him than thy wish wouldgive unto me: but to no man's mind it came, that he had aforetimehis pleasure of me; nay not once.""Evil speech thou speakest," says Brynhild; "when thy wrath runsoff thou wilt rue it; but come now, let us no more cast angrywords one at the other!"Says Gudrun, "Thou wert the first to cast such words at me, andnow thou makest as if thou wouldst amend it, but a cruel and hardheart abides behind.""Let us lay aside vain babble," says Brynhild.  "Long did I holdmy peace concerning my sorrow of heart, and, lo now, thy brotheralone do I love; let us fall to other talk."Gudrun said, "Far beyond all this doth thine heart look."And so ugly ill befell from that going to the river, and thatknowing of the ring, wherefrom did all their talk arise.

So Regin makes a sword, and gives it into Sigurd's hands.  Hetook the sword, and said -- "Behold thy smithying, Regin!" and therewith smote it into theanvil, and the sword brake; so he cast down the brand, and badehim forge a better.Then Regin forged another sword, and brought it to Sigurd, wholooked thereon.Then said Regin, "Belike thou art well content therewith, hardmaster though thou be in smithying."So Sigurd proved the sword, and brake it even as the first; thenhe said to Regin --"Ah, art thou, mayhappen, a traitor and a liar like to thoseformer kin of thine?"Therewith he went to his mother, and she welcomed him in seemlywise, and they talked and drank together.Then spake Sigurd, "Have I heard aright, that King Sigmund gavethee the good sword Gram in two pieces?""True enough," she said.So Sigurd said, "Deliver them into my hands, for I would havethem."She said he looked like to win great fame, and gave him thesword.  Therewith went Sigurd to Regin, and bade him make a goodsword thereof as he best might; Regin grew wroth thereat, butwent into the smithy with the pieces of the sword, thinking wellmeanwhile that Sigurd pushed his head far enow into the matter ofsmithying.  So he made a sword, and as he bore it forth from theforge, it seemed to the smiths as though fire burned along theedges thereof.  Now he bade Sigurd take the sword, and said heknew not how to make a sword if this one failed.  Then Sigurdsmote it into the anvil, and cleft it down to the stock thereof,and neither burst the sword nor brake it.  Then he praised thesword much, and thereafter went to the river with a lock of wool,and threw it up against the stream, and it fell asunder when itmet the sword.  Then was Sigurd glad, and went home.But Regin said, "Now whereas I have made the sword for thee,belike thou wilt hold to thy troth given, and wilt go meetFafnir?""Surely will I hold thereto," said Sigurd, "yet first must Iavenge my father."Now Sigurd the older he grew, the more he grew in the love of allmen, so that every child loved him well.

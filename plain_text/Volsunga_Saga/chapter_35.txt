So when men had drunk their fill, they fared to sleep; then fallsKostbera to beholding the runes, and spelling over the letters,and sees that beneath were other things cut, and that the runesare guileful, yet because of her wisdom she had skill to readthem aright.  So then she goes to bed by her husband; but whenthey awoke, she spake unto Hogni --"Thou art minded to wend away from home -- ill-counselled isthat; abide till another time!  Scarce a keen reader of runes artthou, if thou deemest thou hast beheld in them the bidding of thysister to this journey: lo, I read them the runes, and had marvelof so wise a woman as Gudrun is, that she should have miscutthem; but that which lieth underneath beareth your bane with it,-- yea, either she lacked a letter, or others have dealtguilefully with the runes."And now hearken to my dream; for therein methought there fell inupon us here a river exceeding strong, and brake up the timbersof the hall."He answered, "Full oft are ye evil of mind, ye women, but for me,I was not made in such wise as to meet men with evil who deserveno evil; belike he will give us good welcome."She answered, "Well, the thing must ye yourselves prove, but nofriendship follows this bidding: -- but yet again I dreamed thatanother river fell in here with a great and grimly rush, and toreup the dais of the hall, and brake the legs of both you brethren;surely that betokeneth somewhat."He answers, "Meadows along our way, whereas thou didst dream ofthe river; for when we go through the meadows, plentifully doththe seeds of the hay hang about our legs.""Again I dreamed," she says, "that thy cloak was afire, and thatthe flame blazed up above the hall."Says he, "Well, I wot what that shall betoken; here lieth myfair-dyed raiment, and it shall burn and blaze, whereas thoudreamedst of the cloak.""Methought a bear came in," she says, "and brake up the king'shigh-seat, and shook his paws in such a wise that we were alladrad thereat, and he gat us all together into the mouth of him,so that we might avail us naught, and thereof fell great horroron us."He answered, "Some great storm will befall, whereas thou hadst awhite bear in thy mind.""An erne methought came in," she says, "and swept adown the hall,and drenched me and all of us with blood, and ill shall thatbetoken, for methought it was the double of King Atli."He answered, "Full oft do we slaughter beasts freely, and smitedown great neat for our cheer, and the dream of the erne has butto do with oxen; yea, Atli is heart-whole toward us."And therewithal they cease this talk.

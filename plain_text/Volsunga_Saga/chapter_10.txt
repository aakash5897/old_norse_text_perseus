Now the Volsungs fare back home, and have gained great renown bythese deeds.  But Sinfjotli betook himself to warfare anew; andtherewith he had sight of an exceeding fair woman, and yearnedabove all things for her, but that same woman was wooed also ofthe brother of Borghild, the king's wife: and this matter theyfought out betwixt them, and Sinfjotli slew that king; andthereafter he harried far and wide, and had many a battle andeven gained the day; and he became hereby honoured and renownedabove all men; but in autumn tide he came home with many shipsand abundant wealth.Then he told his tidings to the king his father, and he again tothe queen, and she for her part bids him get him gone from therealm, and made as if she would in nowise see him.  But Sigmundsaid he would not drive him away, and offered her atonement ofgold and great wealth for her brother's life, albeit he said hehad never erst given weregild (1) to any for the slaying of aman, but no fame it was to uphold wrong against a woman.So seeing she might not get her own way herein, she said, "Havethy will in this matter, O my lord, for it is seemly so to be." And now she holds the funeral feast for her brother by the aidand counsel of the king, and makes ready all things there -- or inthe best of wise, and bade thither many great men.At that feast, Borghild the queen bare the drink to folk, and shecame over against Sinfjofli with a great horn, and said --"Fall to now and drink, fair stepson!"Then he took the horn to him, and looked therein, and said --"Nay, for the drink is charmed drink"Then said Sigmund, "Give it unto me then;" and therewith he tookthe horn and drank it off.But the queen said to Sinfjotli, "Why must other men needs drinkthine ale for thee?"  And she came again the second time with thehorn, and said, "Come now and drink!" and goaded him with manywords.And he took the horn, and said --"Guile is in the drink."And thereon, Sigmund cried out --"Give it then unto me!"Again, the third time, she came to him, and bade him drink offhis drink, if he had the heart of a Volsung; then he laid hand onthe horn, but said --"Venom is therein.""Nay, let the lip strain it out then, O son," quoth Sigmund; andby then was he exceeding drunk with drink, and therefore spake hein that wise.So Sinfjotli drank, and straightway fell down dead to the ground.Sigmund rose up, and sorrowed nigh to death over him; then hetook the corpse in his arms and fared away to the wood, and wenttill he came to a certain firth; and then he saw a man in alittle boat; and that man asked if he would be wafted by him overthe firth, and he said yes thereto; but so little was the boat,that they might not all go in it at once, so the corpse was firstlaid therein, while Sigmund went by the firth-side.  Buttherewith the boat and the man therein vanished away from beforeSigmund's eyes. (2)So thereafter Sigmund turned back home, and drave away the queen,and a little after she died.  But Sigmund the king yet ruled hisrealm, and is deemed ever the greatest champion and king of theold law.

In those days came home to Heimir, Brynhild, his foster daughter,and she sat in her bower with her maidens, and could do moreskill in handycraft than other women; she sat, overlaying clothwith gold, and sewing therein the great deeds which Sigurd hadwrought, the slaying of the Worm, and the taking of the wealth ofhim, and the death of Regin withal.Now tells the tale, that on a day Sigurd rode into the wood withhawk, and hound, and men thronging; and whenas he came home hishawk flew up to a high tower and sat him down on a certainwindow.  Then fared Sigurd after his hawk, and he saw where sat afair woman, and knew that it was Brynhild, and he deems allthings he sees there to be worthy together, both her fairness,and the fair things she wrought: and therewith he goes into thehall, but has no more joyance in the games of the men folk.Then spake Alswid, "Why art thou so bare of bliss; this manner ofthine grieveth us thy friends; why then wilt thou not hold to thygleesome ways?  Lo, thy hawks pine now, and thy horse Granidroops; and long will it be ere we are booted thereof?"Sigurd answered, "Good friend, hearken to what lies on my mind;for my hawk flew up into a certain tower; and when I came theretoand took him, lo there I saw a fair woman, and she sat by aneedlework of gold, and did thereon, my deeds that are passed,and my deeds that are to come,"Then said Alswid, "Thou has seen Brynhild, Budli's daughter, thegreatest of great women.""Yea, verily," said Sigurd; "but how came she hither?"Aswid answered, "Short space there was betwixt the coming hitherof the twain of you."Says Sigurd, "Yea, but a few, days agone I knew her for the bestof the world's women."Alswid said, "Give not all thine heed to one woman, being such aman as thou art; ill life to sit lamenting for what we may nothave.""I shall go meet her," says Sigurd, "and get from her love likemy love, and give her a gold ring in token thereof."Alswid answered, "None has ever yet been known whom she would letsit beside her, or to whom she would give drink; for ever willshe hold to warfare and to the winning of all kinds of fame."Sigurd said, "We know not for sure whether she will give usanswer or not, or grant us a seat beside her."So the next day after, Sigurd went to the bower, but Alswid stoodoutside the bower door, fitting shafts to his arrows.Now Sigurd spake, "Abide, fair and hale lady, -- how farestthou?"She answered, "Well it fares; my kin and my friends live yet: butwho shall say what goodhap folk may bear to their life's end?"He sat him down by her, and there came in four damsels with greatgolden beakers, and the best of wine therein; and these stoodbefore the twain.Then said Brynhild, "This seat is for few, but and if my fathercome."He answered, "Yet is it granted to one that likes me well."Now that chamber was hung with the best and fairest of hanging,and the floor thereof was all covered with cloth.Sigurd spake, "Now has it come to pass even as thou didstpromise.""O be thou welcome here!" said she, and arose there with, and thefour damsels with her, and bore the golden beaker to him, andbade him drink; he stretched oui his hand to the beaker, and tookit, and her hand withal, and drew her down beside him; and casthis arms round about her neck and kissed her, and said --"Thou art the fairest that was ever born!"But Brynhild said, "Ah, wiser is it not to cast faith and trothinto a woman's power, for ever shall they break that they havepromised."He said, "That day would dawn the best of days over our headswhereon each of each should be made happy."Brynhild answered, "It is not fated that we should abidetogether; I am a shield-may, and wear helm on head even as thekings of war, and them full oft I help, neither is the battlebecome loathsome to me."Sigurd answered, "What fruit shall be of our life, if we live nottogether: harder to bear this pain that lies hereunder, than thestroke of sharp sword."Brynhild answers, "I shall gaze on the hosts of the war kings,but thou shalt wed Gudrun, the daughter of Giuki."Sigurd answered, "What king's daughter lives to beguile me? Neither am I double-hearted herein; and now I swear by the Godsthat thee shall I have for mine own, or no woman else.And even suchlike wise spake she.8igurd thanked her for her speech, and gave her a gold ring, andnow they swore oath anew, and so he went his ways to his men, andis with them awhile in great bliss.

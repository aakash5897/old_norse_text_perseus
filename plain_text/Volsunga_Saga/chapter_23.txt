Forth Sigurd fides till he comes to a great and goodly dwelling,the lord whereof was a mighty chief called Heimir; he had to wifea sister of Brynhild, who was hight Bekkhild, because she hadbidden at home, and learned handicraft, whereas Brynhild faredwith helm and byrny, unto the wars, wherefore was she calledBrynhild.Heimir and Bekkhild had a son called Alswid, the most courteousof men.Now at this stead were men disporting them abroad, but when theysee the man riding thereto, they leave their play to wonder athim, for none such had they ever seen erst, so they went to meethim, and gave him good welcome.  Alswid bade him abide and havesuch things at his hands as he would; and he takes his biddingblithesomely; due service withal was established for him; fourmen bore the treasure of gold from off the horse, and the fifthtook it to him to guard the same; therein were many things tobehold, things of great price, and seldom seen; and great gameand joy men had to look on byrnies and helms, and mighty rings,and wondrous great golden stoups, and all kinds of war weapons.So there dwelt Sigurd long in great honour holden; and tidings ofthat deed of fame spread wide through all lands, of how he hadslain that hideous and fearful dragon.  So good joyance had theythere together, and each was leal to other; and their sport wasin the arraying of their weapons, and the shafting of theirarrows, and the flying of their falcons.

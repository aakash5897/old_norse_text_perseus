Now tells the tale of Gunnar, that in the same wise it fared withhim; for when they awoke, Glaumvor his wife told him many dreamswhich seemed to her like to betoken guile coming; but Gunnarareded them all in other wise."This was one of them," said she; "methought a bloody sword wasborne into the hall here, wherewith thou wert thrust through, andat either end of that wolves howled."The king answered, "Our dogs shall bite me belike; blood-stainedweapons oft betoken dogs' snappings."She said, "Yet again I dreamed -- that women came in, heavy anddrooping, and chose thee for their mate; may-happen these wouldbe thy fateful women."He answered, "Hard to arede is this, and none may set aside thefated measure of his days, nor is it unlike that my time isshort." (1)So in the morning they arose, and were minded for the journey,but some letted them herein.Then cried Gunnar to the man who is called Fjornir --"Arise, and give us to drink goodly wine from great tuns, becausemay happen this shall be very last of all our feasts; belike ifwe die the old wolf shall come by the gold, and that bear shallnowise spare the bite of his war-tusks."Then all the folk of his household brought them on their wayweeping.The son of Hogni said --"Fare ye well with merry tide."The more part of their folk were left behind; Solar and Gnoevar,the sons of Hogni, fared with them, and a great champion, namedOrkning, who was the brother of Kostbera.So folk followed them down to the ships, and all fetted them oftheir journey, but attained to naught therein.Then spake Glaumvor, and said --"O Vingi, most like that great ill hap will come of thy coming,and mighty and evil things shall betide in thy travelling."He answered, "Hearken to my answer; that I lie not aught: and maythe high gallows and all things of grame have me, if I lie oneword!"Then cried Kostbera, "Fare ye well with merry days."And Hogni answered, "Be glad of heart, howsoever it may fare withus!"And therewith they parted, each to their own fate.  Then awaythey rowed, so hard and fast, that well-nigh the half of the keelslipped away from the ship, and so hard they laid on to the oarsthat thole and gunwale brake.But when they came aland they made their ship fast, and then theyrode awhile on their noble steeds through the murk wild-wood.And now they behold the king's army, and huge uproar, and theclatter of weapons they hear from thence; and they see there amighty host of men, and the manifold array of them, even as theywrought there: and all the gates of the burg were full of men.So they rode up to the burg, and the gates thereof were shut;then Hogni brake open the gates, and therewith they ride into theburg.Then spake Vingi, "Well might ye have left this deed undone; goto now, bide ye here while I go seek your gallows-tree!  Softlyand sweetly I base you hither, but an evil thing abodethereunder; short while to bide ere ye are tied up to that sametree!"Hogni answered, "None the more shall we waver for that cause; forlittle methinks have we shrunk aback whenas men fell to fight;and naught shall it avail thee to make us afeard, -- and for anill fate hast thou wrought."And therewith they cast him down to earth, and smote him withtheir axe-hammers till he died.

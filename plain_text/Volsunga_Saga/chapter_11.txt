There was a king called Eylimi, mighty and of great fame, and hisdaughter was called Hjordis, the fairest and wisest of womankind;and Sigmund hears it told of her that she was meet to be hiswife, yea if none else were.  So he goes to the house of KingEylimi, who would make a great feast for him, if so be he comesnot thither in the guise of a foe.  So messages were sent fromone to the other that this present journey was a peaceful one,and not for war; so the feast was held in the best of wise andwith many a man thereat; fairs were in every place establishedfor King Sigmund, and all things else were done to the aid andcomfort of his journey: so he came to the feast, and both kingshold their state in one hall; thither also was come King Lyngi,son of King Hunding, and he also is a-wooing the daughter of KingEylimi.Now the king deemed he knew that the twain had come thither butfor one errand, and thought withal that war and trouble might belooked for from the hands of him who brought not his end about;so he spake to his daughter, and said --"Thou art a wise woman, and I have spoken it, that thou aloneshalt choose a husband for thyself; choose therefore betweenthese two kings, and my rede shall be even as thine.""A hard and troublous matter," says she; "yet will I choose himwho is of greatest fame, King Sigmund to wife albeit he is wellstricken in years."So to him was she betrothed, and King Lyngi gat him gone.  Thenwas Sigmund wedded to Hjordis, and now each day was the feastbetter and more glorious than on the day before it.  Butthereafter Sigmund went back home to Hunland, and King Eylimi,his father-in-law, with him, and King Sigmund betakes himself tothe due ruling of his realm.But King Lyngi and his brethren gather an army together to fallon Sigmund, for as in all matters they were wont to have theworser lot, so did this bite the sorest of all; and they wouldfain prevail over the might and pride of the Volsungs.  So theycame to Hunland, and sent King Sigmund word how that they wouldnot steal upon him and that they deemed he would scarce slinkaway from them.  So Sigmund said he would come and meet them inbattle, and drew his power together; but Hjordis was borne intothe wood with a certain bondmaid, and mighty wealth went withthem; and there she abode the while they fought.Now the vikings rushed from their ships in numbers not to beborne up against, but Sigmund the King, and Eylimi set up theirbanners, and the horns blew up to battle; but King Sigmund letblow the horn his father erst had had, and cheered on his men tothe fight, but his army was far the fewest.Now was that battle fierce and fell, and though Sigmund were old,yet most hardily he fought, and was ever the foremost of his men;no shield or byrny might hold against him, and he went everthrough the ranks of his foemen on that day, and no man might seehow things would fare between them; many an arrow and many aspear was aloft in air that day, and so his spae-wrights wroughtfor him that he got no wound, and none can tell over the tale ofthose who fell before him, and both his arms were red with blood,even to the shoulders.But now whenas the battle had dured a while, there came a maninto the fight clad in a blue cloak, and with a slouched hat onhis head, one-eyed he was, (1)  and bare a bill in his hand; andhe came against Sigmund the King, and have up his bill againsthim, and as Sigmund smote fiercely with the sword it fell uponthe bill and burst asunder in the midst: thenceforth theslaughter and dismay turned to his side, for the good-hap of KingSigmund had departed from him, and his men fell fast about him;naught did the king spare himself, but the rather cheered on hismen; but even as the saw says, "No might 'gainst many", so was itnow proven; and in this fight fell Sigmund the King, and KingEylimi, his father-in-law, in the fore-front of their battle, andtherewith the more part of their folk.

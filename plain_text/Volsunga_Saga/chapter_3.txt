There was a king called Siggeir, who ruled over Gothland, amighty king and of many folk; he went to meet Volsung, the king,and prayed him for Signy his daughter to wife; and the king tookhis talk well, and his sons withal, but she was loth thereto, yetshe bade her father rule in this as in all other things thatconcerned her, so the king took such rede (1) that he gave her tohim, and she was betrothed to King Siggeir; and for thefulfilling of the feast and the wedding, was King Siggeir to cometo the house of King Volsung.  The king got ready the feastaccording to his best might, and when all things were ready, camethe king's guests and King Siggeir withal at the day appointed,and many a man of great account had Siggeir with him.The tale tells that great fires were made endlong the hall, andthe great tree aforesaid stood midmost thereof, withal folk saythat, whenas men sat by the fires in the evening, a certain mancame into the hall unknown of aspect to all men; and suchlikearray he had, that over him was a spotted cloak, and he was bare-foot, and had linen-breeches knit tight even unto the bone, andhe had a sword in his hand as he went up to the Branstock, and aslouched hat upon his head: huge he was, and seeming-ancient, andone-eyed. (2)  So he drew his sword and smote it into the tree-trunk so that it sank in up to the hilts; and all held back fromgreeting the man.  Then he took up the word, and said --"Whoso draweth this sword from this stock, shall have the same asa gift from me, and shall find in good sooth that never bare hebetter sword in hand than is this."Therewith out went the old man from the hall, and none knew whohe was or whither he went.Now men stand up, and none would fain be the last to lay hand tothe sword, for they deemed that he would have the best of it whomight first touch it; so all the noblest went thereto first, andthen the others, one after other; but none who came thereto mightavail to pull it out, for in nowise would it come away howsoeverthey tugged at it; but now up comes Sigmund, King Volsung's son,and sets hand to the sword, and pulls it from the stock, even asif it lay loose before him; so good that weapon seemed to all,that none thought he had seen such a sword before, and Siggeirwould fain buy it of him at thrice its weight of gold, butSigmund said --"Thou mightest have taken the sword no less than I from therewhereas it stood, if it had been thy lot to bear it; but now,since it has first of all fallen into my hand, never shalt thouhave it, though thou biddest therefor all the gold thou hast." King Siggeir grew wroth at these words, and deemed Sigmund hadanswered him scornfully, but whereas was a wary man and a double-dealing, he made as if he heeded this matter in nowise, yet thatsame evening he thought how he might reward it, as was well seenafterwards.

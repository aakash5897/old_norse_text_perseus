Now they array them joyously for their journey, and ride overhill and dale to the house of King Budli, and woo his daughter ofhim; in a good wise he took their speech, if so be that sheherself would not deny them, but he said withal that so high-minded was she, that that man only might wed her whom she would.Then they ride to Hlymdale, and there Heimir gave them goodwelcome; so Gunnar tells his errand; Heimir says, that she mustneeds wed but him whom she herself chose freely; and tells themhow her abode was but a little way thence, and that he deemedthat him only would she have who should ride through the flamingfire that was drawn round about her hall; so they depart and cometo the hall and the fire, and see there a castle with a goldenroof-ridge, and all round about a fire roaring up.Now Gunnar rode on Goti, but Hogni on Holkvi, and Gunnar smotehis horse to face the fire, but he shrank aback.Then said Sigurd, "Why givest thou back, Gunnar?"He answered, "The horse will not tread this fire; but lend me thyhorse Grani.""Yea, with all my good will," says Sigurd.Then Gunnar rides him at the fire, and yet nowise will Gram stir,nor may Gunnar any the more ride through that fire.  So now theychange semblance, Gunnar and Sigurd, even as Grimhild had taughtthem; then Sigurd in the likeness of Gunnar mounts and rides,Gram in his hand, and golden spurs on his heels; then leapt Graniinto the fire when he felt the spurs; and a mighty roar arose asthe fire burned ever madder, and the earth trembled, and theflames went up even unto the heavens, nor had any dared to rideas he rode, even as it were through the deep mirk.But now the fire sank withal, and he leapt from his horse andwent into the hall, even as the song says --"The flame flared at its maddest,Earth's fields fell a-quakingAs the red flame aloftLicked the lowest of heaven.Few had been fain,Of the rulers of folk,To ride through that flame,Or athwart it to tread."Then Sigurd smoteGrani with sword,And the flame was slakedBefore the king;Low lay the flamesBefore the fain of fame;Bright gleamed the arrayThat Regin erst owned.Now when Sigurd had passed through the fire, he came into acertain fair dwelling, and therein sat Brynhild.She asked, "What man is it?"Then he named himself Gunnar, son of Giuki, and said -- "Thou artawarded to me as my wife, by the good will and word of thy fatherand thy foster-father, and I have ridden through the flame of thyfire, according to thy that thou hast set forth.""I wot not clearly," said she, "how I shall answer thee."Now Sigurd stood upright on the hall floor, and leaning on thehilt of his sword, and he spake to Brynhild --"In reward thereof, shall I pay thee a great dower in gold andgoodly things?"She answered in heavy mood from her seat, whereas she sat likeunto swan on billow, having a sword in her hand and a helm on herhead, and being clad in a byrny, "O Gunnar," she says, "speak notto me of such things unless thou be the first and best of allmen; for then shall thou slay those my wooers, if thou hast heartthereto; I have been in battles with the king of the Greeks, andweapons were stained with red blood, and for such things still Iyearn."He answered, "Yea, certes many great deeds hast thou done; butyet call thou to mind thine oath, concerning the riding throughof this fire, wherein thou didst swear that thou wouldst go withthe man who should do this deed."So she found that he spoke but the sooth, and she paid heed tohis words, and arose, and greeted him meetly, and he abode therethree nights, and they lay in one bed together; but he took thesword Gram and laid it betwixt them: then she asked him why helaid it there; and he answered, that in that wise must he needswed his wife or else get his bane.Then she took from off her the ring Andvari's loom, which he hadgiven her aforetime, and gave it to him, but he gave her anotherring out of Fafnir's hoard.Thereafter he rode away through the same fire unto his Fellows,and he and Gunnar changed semblances again, and rode untoHlymdale, and told how it had gone with them.That same day went Brynhild home to her foster-father, and tellshim as one whom she trusted, how that there had come a king toher; "And he rode through my flaming fire, and said he was cometo woo me, and named himself Gunnar; but I said that such a deedmight Sigurd alone have done, with whom I plighted troth on themountain; and he is my first troth-plight, and my well-beloved." Heimir said that things must needs abide even as now they had nowcome to pass.Brynhild said, "Aslaug the daughter of me and Sigurd shall benourished here with thee."Now the kings fare home, but Brynhild goes to her father;Grimhild welcomes the kings meetly, and thanks Sigurd for hisfellowship; and withal is a great feast made, and many were theguests thereat; and thither came Budli the King with his daughterBrynhild, and his son Atli, and for many days did the feastendure: and at that feast was Gunnar wedded to Brynhild: but whenit was brought to an end, once more has Sigurd memory of all theoaths that he sware unto Brynhild, yet withal he let all thingsabide in rest and peace.Brynhild and Gunnar sat together in great game and glee, anddrank goodly wine.

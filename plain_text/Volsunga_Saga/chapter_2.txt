Now Sigi grew old, and had many to envy him, so that at lastthose turned against him whom he trusted most; yea, even thebrothers of his wife; for these fell on him at his unwariest,when there were few with him to withstand them, and brought somany against him, that they prevailed against him, and there fellSigi and all his folk with him.  But Rerir, his son, was not inthis trouble, and he brought together so mighty a strength of hisfriends and the great men of the land, that he got to himselfboth the lands and kingdom of Sigi his father; and so now, whenhe deems that the feet under him stand firm in his rule, then hecalls to mind that which he had against his mother's brothers,who had slain his father.  So the king gathers together a mightyarmy, and therewith falls on his kinsmen, deeming that if he madetheir kinship of small account, yet none the less they had firstwrought evil against him.  So he wrought his will herein, in thathe departed not from strife before he had slain all his father'sbanesmen, though dreadful the deed seemed in every wise.  So nowhe gets land, lordship, and fee, and is become a mightier manthan his father before him.Much wealth won in war gat Rerir to himself, and wedded a wifewithal, such as he deemed meet for him, and long they livedtogether, but had no child to take the heritage after them; andill-content they both were with that, and prayed the Gods withheart and soul that they might get them a child.  And so it issaid that Odin hears their prayer, and Freyia no less hearkenswherewith they prayed unto her: so she, never lacking for allgood counsel, calls to her her casket-bearing may, (1) thedaughter of Hrimnir the giant, and sets an apple in her hand, andbids her bring it to the king.  She took the apple, and did onher the gear of a crow, and went flying till she came whereas theking sat on a mound, and there she let the apple fall into thelap of the king; but he took the apple and deemed he knew wheretoit would avail; so he goes home from the mound to his own folk,and came to the queen, and some deal of that apple she ate.So, as the tale tells, the queen soon knew that she big withchild, but a long time wore or ever she might give birth to thechild: so it befell that the king must needs go to the wars,after the custom of kings, that he may keep his own land inpeace: and in this journey it came to pass that Rerir fell sickand got his death, being minded to go home to Odin, a thing muchdesired of many folk in those days.Now no otherwise it goes with the queen's sickness thanheretofore, nor may she be the lighter of her child, and sixwinters wore away with the sickness still heavy on her; so thatat the last she feels that she may not live long; wherefore nowshe bade cut the child from out of her; and it was done even asshe bade; a man-child was it, and great of growth from his birth,as might well be; and they say that the youngling kissed hismother or ever she died; but to him is a name given, and he iscalled Volsung; and he was king over Hunland in the room of hisfather.  From his early years he was big and strong, and full ofdaring in all manly deeds and trials, and he became the greatestof warriors, and of good hap in all the battles of his warfaring. Now when he was fully come to man's estate, Hrimnir the giantsends to him Ljod his daughter; she of whom the tale told, thatshe brought the apple to Rerir, Volsung's father.  So Volsungweds her withal; and long they abode together with good hap andgreat love.  They had ten sons and one daughter, and their eldestson was hight Sigmund, and their daughter Signy; and these twowere twins, and in all wise the foremost and the fairest of thechildren of Volsung the king, and mighty, as all his seed was;even as has been long told from ancient days, and in tales oflong ago, with the greatest fame of all men, how that theVolsungs have been great men and high-minded and far above themost of men both in cunning and in prowess and all things highand mighty.So says the story that king Volsung let build a noble hall insuch a wise, that a big oak-tree stood therein, and that thelimbs of the tree blossomed fair out over the roof of the hall,while below stood the trunk within it, and the said trunk did mencall Branstock.

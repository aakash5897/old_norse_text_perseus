There was a man hight Grifir,(1) who was Sigurd's mother'sbrother, and a little after the forging of the sword Sigurd wentto Grifir, because he was a man who knew things to come, and whatwas fated to men: of him Sigurd asked diligently how his lifeshould go; but Grifir was long or he spake, yet at the last, byreason of Sigurd's exceeding great prayers, he told him all hislife and the fate thereof, even as afterwards came to pass.  Sowhen Grifir had told him all even as he would, he went back home;and a little after he and Regin met.Then said Regin, "Go thou and slay Fafnir, even as thou hastgiven thy word."Sigurd said, "That work shall be wrought; but another is first tobe done, the avenging of Sigmund the king and the other of mykinsmen who fell in that their last fight."

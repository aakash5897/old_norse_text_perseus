Now Sigurd goes his ways with all that great treasure, and infriendly wise he departs from them; and on Grani he rides withall his war-gear and the burden withal; and thus he rides untilhe comes to the hall of King Giuki; there he rides into the burg,and that sees one of the king's men, and he spake withal --"Sure it may be deemed that here is come one of the Gods, for hisarray is all done with gold, and his horse is far mightier thanother horses, and the manner of his weapons is most exceedinggoodly, and most of all the man himself far excels all other menever seen."So the king goes out with his court and greets the man, and asks--"Who art thou who thus ridest into my burg, as none has dursthitherto without the leave of my sons?"He answered, "I am called Sigurd, son of King Sigmund."Then said King Giuki, "Be thou welcome here then, and take at ourhands whatso thou wiliest."So he went into the king's hall, and all men seemed little besidehim, and all men served him, and there he abode in great joyance.Now oft they all ride abroad together, Sigurd and Gunnar andHogni, and ever is Sigurd far the foremost of them, mighty men oftheir hands though they were.But Grimhild finds how heartily Sigurd loved Brynhild, and howoft he talks of her; and she falls to thinking how well it were,if he might abide there and wed the daughter of King Giuki, forshe saw that none might come anigh to his goodliness, and whatfaith and goodhelp there was in him, and how that he had morewealth withal than folk might tell of any man; and the king didto him even as unto his own sons, and they for their parts heldhim of more worth than themselves.So on a night as they sat at the drink, the queen arose, and wentbefore Sigurd, and said --"Great joy we have in thine abiding here, and all good thingswill we put before thee to take of us; lo now, take this horn anddrink thereof."So he took it and drank, and therewithal she said, "Thy fathershall be Giuki the king, and I shall be thy mother, and Gunnarand Hogni shall be thy brethren, and all this shall be sworn withoaths each to each; and then surely shall the like of you neverbe found on earth."Sigurd took her speech well, for with the drinking of that drinkall memory of Brynhild departed from him.  So there he abodeawhile.And on a day went Grimhild to Giuki the king, and cast her armsabout his neck, and spake --"Behold, there has now come to us the greatest of great heartsthat the world holds; and needs must he be trusty and of greatavail; give him thy daughter then, with plenteous wealth, and asmuch of rule as he will; perchance thereby he will be wellcontent to abide here ever."The king answered, "Seldom does it befall that kings offer theirdaughters to any; yet in higher wise will it be done to offer herto this man, than to take lowly prayers to her from others."On a night Gudrun pours out the drink, and Sigurd beholds her howfair she is and how full of all courtesy.Five seasons Sigurd abode there, and ever they passed their daystogether in good honour and friendship.And so it befell that the king held talk together, and Giuki said--"Great good thou givest us, Sigurd, and with exceeding strengththou strengthenest our realm."Then Gunnar said, "All things that may be will we do for thee, sothou abidest here long; both dominion shall thou have, and oursister freely and unprayed for, whom another man would not getfor all his prayers."Sigurd says, "Thanks have ye for this wherewith; ye honour me,and gladly will I take the same."Therewith they swore brotherhood together, and to be even as ifthey were children of one father and one mother; and a noblefeast was holden, and endured many days, and Sigurd drank at thewedding of him and Gudrun; and there might men behold all mannerof game and glee, and each day the feast was better and better. Now fare these folk wide over the world, and do many great deeds,and slay many kings' sons, and no man has ever done such works ofprowess as did they; then home they come again with much wealthwon in war.Sigurd gave of the serpent's heart to Gudrun, and she atethereof, and became greater-hearted, and wiser than ere before:and the son of these twain was called Sigmund.Now on a time went Grimhild to Gunnar her son, and spake --"Fair blooms the life and fortune of thee, but for one thingonly, and namely whereas thou art unwedded; go woo Brynhild; goodrede is this, and Sigurd will ride with thee."Gunnar answered, "Fair in she certes, and I am fain enow to winher;" and therewith he tells his father, and his brethren, andSigurd, and they all prick him on to that wooing.

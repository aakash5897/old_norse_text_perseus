Now tells the tale of King Volsung and his sons that they go atthe time appointed to Gothland at the bidding of King Siggeir,and put off from the land in three ships, all well manned, andhave a fair voyage, and made Gothland late of an evening tide. But that same night came Signy and called her father and brothersto a privy talk, and told them what she deemed King Siggeir wasminded to do, and how that he had drawn together an army no manmay meet.  "And," says she, "he is minded to do guilefully byyou; wherefore I bid you get ye gone back again to your own land,and gather together the mightiest power ye may, and then comeback hither and avenge you; neither go ye now to your undoing,for ye shall surely fail not to fall by his wiles if ye turn noton him even as I bid you."Then spake Volsung the king, "All people and nations shall tellof the word I spake, yet being unborn, wherein I vowed a vow thatI would flee in fear from neither fire nor the sword; even sohave I done hitherto, and shall I depart therefrom now I am old?Yea withal never shall the maidens mock these my sons at thegames, and cry out at them that they fear death; once alone mustall men need die, and from that season shall none escape; so myrede is that we flee nowhither, but do the work of our hands inas manly wise as we may; a hundred fights have I fought andwhiles I had more, and whiles I had less, and yet even had I thevictory, nor shall it ever be heard tell of me that I fled awayor prayed for peace."Then Signy wept right sore, and prayed that she might not go backto King Siggeir, but King Volsung answered --"Thou shalt surely go back to thine husband, and abide with him,howsoever it fares with us."So Signy went home, and they abode there that night but in themorning, as soon as it was day, Volsung bade his men arise and goaland and make them ready for battle; so they went aland, all ofthem all-armed, and had not long to wait before Siggeir fell onthem with all his army, and the fiercest fight there was betwixtthem; and Siggeir cried on his men to the onset all he might; andso the tale tells that King Volsung and his sons went eight timesright through Siggeir's folk that day, smiting and hewing oneither hand, but when they would do so even once again, KingVolsung fell amidst his folk and all his men withal, saving histen sons, for mightier was the power against them than they mightwithstand.But now are all his sons taken, and laid in bonds and led away;and Signy was ware withal that her father was slain, and herbrothers taken and doomed to death, that she called King Siggeirapart to talk with her, and said --"This will I pray of thee, that thou let not slay my brothershastily, but let them be set awhile in the stocks, for home to mecomes the saw that says, "Sweet to eye while seen": but longerlife I pray not for them, because I wot well that my prayer willnot avail me."Then answered Siggeir  "Surely thou art mad and witless, praying thus for more bale forthy brothers than their present slaying; yet this will I grantthee, for the better it likes me the more they must bear, and thelonger their pain is or ever death come to them."Now he let it be done even as she prayed, and a mighty beam wasbrought and set on the feet of those ten brethren in a certainplace of the wild-wood, and there they sit day-long until night;but at midnight, as they sat in the stocks, there came on them ashe-wolf from out the wood; old she was, and both great and evilof aspect; and the first thing she did was to bite one of thosebrethren till he died, and then she ate him up withal, and wenton her way.But the next morning Signy sent a man to the brethren, even onewhom she most trusted, to wot of the tidings; and when he cameback he told her that one of them was dead, and great andgrievous she deemed it, if they should all fare in like wise, andyet naught might she avail them.Soon is the tale told thereof: nine nights together came the she-wolf at midnight, and each night slew and ate up one of thebrethren, until all were dead, save Sigmund only; so now, beforethe tenth night came, Signy sent that trusty man to Sigmund, herbrother, and gave honey into his hand, bidding him do it overSigmund's face, and set a little deal of it in his mouth; so hewent to Sigmund and did as he was bidden, and then came homeagain; and so the next night came the she-wolf according to herwont, and would slay him and eat him even as his brothers; butnow she sniffs the breeze from him, whereas he was anointed withthe honey, and licks his face all over with her tongue, and thenthrusts her tongue into the mouth of him.  No fear he hadthereof, but caught the she-wolf's tongue betwixt his teeth, andso hard she started back thereat, and pulled herself away somightily, setting her feet against the stock that all was rivenasunder; but he ever held so fast that the tongue came away bythe roots, and thereof she had her bane.But some men say that this same she-wolf was the mother of KingSiggeir, who had turned herself into this likeness by troll'slore and witchcraft.

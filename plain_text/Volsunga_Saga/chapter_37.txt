Then they rode unto the king's hall, and King Atli arrayed hishost for battle, and the ranks were so set forth that a certainwall there was betwixt them and the brethren."Welcome hither," said he. "Deliver unto me that plenteous goldwhich is mine of right; even the wealth which Sigurd once owned,and which is now Gudrun's of right."Gunnar answered, "Never gettest thou that wealth; and men ofmight must thou meet here, or ever we lay by life if thou wiltdeal with us in battle; ah, belike thou settest forth this feastlike a great man, and wouldst not hold thine hand from erne andwolf!""Long ago I had it in my mind," said Atli, to take the lives ofyou, and be lord of the gold, and reward you for that deed ofshame, wherein ye beguiled the best of all your affinity; but nowshall I revenge him."Hogni answered, "Little will it avail to lie long brooding overthat rede, leaving the work undone."And therewith they fell to hard fighting, at the first brunt withshot.But therewithal came the tidings to Gudrun, and when she heardthereof she grew exceeding wroth, and cast her mantle from her,and ran out and greeted those new-comers, and kissed herbrethren, and showed them all love, -- and the last of allgreetings was that betwixt them.Then said she, "I thought I had set forth counsel whereby yeshould not come hither, but none may deal with his shapen fate."And withal she said, "Will it avail aught to seek for peace?"But stoutly and grimly they said nay thereto.  So she sees thatthe game goeth sorely against her brethren, and she gathers toher great stoutness of heart, and does on her a mail-coat andtakes to her a sword, and fights by her brethren, and goes as farforward as the bravest of man-folk; and all spoke in one wisethat never saw any fairer defence than in her.Now the men fell thick, and far before all others was thefighting of those brethren, and the battle endured a long whileunto midday; Gunnar and Hogni went right through the folk ofAtli, and so tells the tale that all the mead ran red with blood;the sons of Hogni withal set on stoutly.Then spake Atli the king, "A fair host and a great have we, andmighty champions withal, and yet have many of us fallen, and butevil am I apaid in that nineteen of my champions are slain, andbut left six alive."And therewithal was there a lull in the battle.Then spake Atli the king, "Four brethren were we, and now am Ileft alone; great affinity I gat to me, and deemed my fortunewell sped thereby; a wife I had, fair and wise, high of mind, andgreat of heart; but no joyance may I have of her wisdom, forlittle peace is betwixt us, -- but ye -- ye have slain many of mykin, and beguiled me of realm and riches, and for the greatest ofall woes have slain my sister withal."Quoth Hogni, "Why babblest thou thus?  Thou wert the first tobreak the peace.  Thou didst take my kinswoman and pine her todeath by hunger, and didst murder her, and take her wealth; anugly deed for a king! -- meet for mocking and laughter I deem it,that thou must needs make long tale of thy woes; rather will Igive thanks to the Gods that thou fallest into ill."

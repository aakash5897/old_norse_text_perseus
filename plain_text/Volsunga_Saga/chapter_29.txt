After this talk Brynhild lay a-bed, and tidings were brought toKing Gunnar that Brynhild was sick; he goes to see her thereon,and asks what ails her; but she answered him naught, but laythere as one dead: and when he was hard on her for an answer, shesaid --"What didst thou with that ring that I gave thee, even the onewhich King Budli gave me at our last parting, when thou and KingGiuki came to him and threatened fire and the sword, unless yehad me to wife?  Yea, at that time he led me apart, and asked mewhich I had chosen of those who were come; but I prayed him thatI might abide to ward the land and be chief over the third partof his men; then were there two choices for me to deal betwixteither that I should be wedded to him whom he would, or lose allmy weal and friendship at his hands; and he said withal that his friendship would be better to me than his wrath: then I bethoughtme whether I should yield to his will, or slay many a man; andtherewithal I deemed that it would avail little to strive withhim, and so it fell out, that I promised to wed whomsoever shouldride the horse Grani with Fafnir's Hoard, and ride through myflaming fire, and slay those men whom I called on him to slay,and now so it was, that none durst ride, save Sigurd only,because he lacked no heart thereto; yea, and the Worm he flew,and Regin, and five kings beside; but thou, Gunnar, durst donaught; as pale as a dead man didst thou wax, and no king thouart, and no champion; so whereas I made a vow unto my father,that him alone would I love who was the noblest man alive, andthat this is none save Sigurd, lo, now have I broken my oath andbrought it to naught, since he is none of mine, and for thiscause shall I compass thy death; and a great reward of evilthings have I wherewith to reward Grimhild; -- never, I wot, haswoman lived eviler or of lesser heart than she."Gunnar answered in such wise that few might hear him, "Many avile word hast thou spoken, and an evil-hearted woman art thou,whereas thou revilest a woman far better than thou; never wouldshe curse her life as thou dost; nay, nor has she tormented deadfolk, or murdered any; but lives her life well praised of all."Brynhild answered, "Never have I dwelt with evil things privily,or done loathsome deeds; -- yet most fain I am to slay thee."And therewith would she slay King Gunnar, but Hogni laid her infetters; but then Gunnar spake withal --"Nay, I will not that she abide in fetters."Then said she, "Heed it not!  For never again seest thou me gladin thine hall, never drinking, never at the chess-play, neverspeaking the words of kindness, never over-laying the fair clothswith gold, never giving thee good counsel; -- ah, my sorrow ofheart that I might not get Sigurd to me!"Then she sat up and smote her needlework, and rent it asunder,and bade set open her bower doors, that far away might thewailings of her sorrow be heard; then great mourning andlamentation there was, so that folk heard far and wide throughthat abode.Now Gudrun asked her bower-maidens why they sat so joyless anddowncast.  "What has come to you, that ye fare ye as witlesswomen, or what unheard-of wonders have befallen you?"Then answered a waiting lady, hight Swaflod, "An untimely, anevil day it is, and our hall is fulfilled of lamentation."Then spake Gudrun to one of her handmaids, "Arise, for we haveslept long; go, wake Brynhild, and let us fall to our needleworkand be merry.""Nay, nay," she says, "nowise may I wake her, or talk with her;for many days has she drunk neither mead nor wine; surely thewrath of the Gods has fallen upon her."Then spake Gudrun to Gunnar, "Go and see her," she says, "and bidher know that I am grieved with her grief.""Nay," says Gunnar, "I am forbid to go see her or to share herweal."Nevertheless he went unto her, and strives in many wise to havespeech of her, but gets no answer whatsoever; therefore he getshim gone and finds Hogni, and bids him go see her: he said he wasloth thereto, but went, and gat no more of her.Then they go and find Sigurd, and pray him to visit her; heanswered naught thereto, and so matters abode for that night.But the next day, when he came home from hunting, Sigurd went toGudrun, and spake --"In such wise do matters show to me, as though great and evilthings will betide from this trouble and upheaving; and thatBrynhild will surely die."Gudrun answers, "O my lord, by great wonders is she encompassed,seven days and seven nights has she slept, and none has daredwake her.""Nay, she sleeps not," said Sigurd, "her heart is dealing ratherwith dreadful intent against me."Then said Gudrun, weeping, "Woe worth the while for thy death! Go and see her; and wot if her fury may not be abated; give hergold, and smother up her grief and anger therewith!"Then Sigurd went out, and found the door of Brynhild's chamberopen; he deemed she slept, and drew the clothes from off her, andsaid --"Awake, Brynhild!  The sun shineth now over all the house, andthou hast slept enough; cast off grief from thee, and take upgladness!"She said, "And how then hast thou dared to come to me?  In thistreason none was worse to me than thou."Said Sigurd, "Why wilt thou not speak to folk?  For what causesorrowest thou?"Brynhild answers, "Ah, to thee will I tell of my wrath!"Sigurd said, "As one under a spell art thou, if thou deemest thatthere is aught cruel in my heart against thee; but thou hast himfor husband whom thou didst choose.""Ah, nay," she said, "never did Gunnar ride through the fire tome, nor did he give me to dower the host of the slain: I wonderedat the man who came into my hall; for I deemed indeed that I knewthine eyes; but I might not see clearly, or divide the good fromthe evil, because of the veil that lay heavy on my fortune."Says Sigurd, "No nobler men are there than the sons of Giuki,they slew the king of the Danes, and that great chief, thebrother of King Budli."Brynhild answered, "Surely for many an ill-deed must I rewardthem; mind me not of my griefs against them!  But thou, Sigurd,slewest the Worm, and rodest the fire through; yea, and for mysake, and not one of the sons of King Giuki."Sigurd answers, "I am not thy husband, and thou art not my wife;yet did a farfamed king pay dower to thee."Says Brynhild, "Never looked I at Gunnar in such a wise that myheart smiled on him; and hard and fell am I to him, though I hideit from others.""A marvellous thing," says Sigurd, "not to love such a king; whatangers thee most?  For surely his love should be better to theethan gold.""This is the sorest sorrow to me," she said, "that the bittersword is not reddened in thy blood.""Have no fear thereof!" says he, "no long while to wait or thebitter sword stand deep in my heart; and no worse needest thou topray for thyself, for thou wilt not live when I am dead; the daysof our two lives shall be few enough from henceforth."Brynhild answers, "Enough and to spare of bale is in thy speech,since thou bewrayedst me, and didst twin (1) me and all bliss; --naught do I heed my life or death."Sigurd answers, "Ah, live, and love King Gunnar and me withal!And all my wealth will I give thee if thou die not."Brynhild answers, "Thou knowest me not, nor the heart that is inme; for thou art the first and best of all men, and I am becomethe most loathsome of all woman to thee.""This is truer," says Sigurd, "that I loved thee better thanmyself, though I fell into the wiles from whence our lives maynot escape; for whenso my own heart and mind availed me, then Isorrowed sore that thou wert not my wife; but as I might I put mytrouble from me, for in a king's dwelling was I; and withal andin spite of all I was well content that we were all together. Well may it be, that that shall come to pass which is foretold;neither shall I fear the fulfilment thereof."Brynhild answered, and said, "Too late thou tellest me that mygrief grieved thee: little pity shall I find now."Sigurd said, "This my heart would, that thou and I should go intoone bed together; even so wouldst thou be my wife."Said Brynhild, "Such words may nowise be spoken, nor will I havetwo kings in one hall; I will lay my life down rather thanbeguile Gunnar the King."And therewith she call to mind how they met, they two, on themountain, and swore oath each to each."But now is all changed and I will not live.""I might not call to mind thy name," said Sigurd, "or know timeagain, before the time of thy wedding; the greatest of all griefsis that."Then said Brynhild, "I swore an oath to wed the man who shouldride my flaming fire, and that oath will I hold to, or die." "Rather than thou die, I will wed thee, and put away Gudrun."said Sigurd.But therewithal so swelled the heart betwixt the sides of him,that the rings of his byrny burst asunder."I will not have thee," says Brynhild, "nay, nor any other!"Then Sigurd got him gone.So saith the song of Sigurd --"Out then went Sigurd,The great kings' well-loved,From the speech and the sorrow,Sore drooping, so grieving,That the shirt round about himOf iron tings woven,From the sides brake asunderOf the brave in the battle."So when Sigurd came into the hall, Gunnar asked if he had come toa knowledge of what great grief lay heavy on her, or if she hadpower of speech: and Sigurd said that she lacked it not.  So nowGunnar goes to her again, and asked her, what wrought her woe, orif there were anything that might amend it."I will not live," says Brynhild, "for Sigurd has bewrayed me,yea, and thee no less, whereas thou didst suffer him to come intomy bed: lo thou, two men in one dwelling I will not have; andthis shall be Sigurd's death, or thy death, or my death; -- fornow has he told Gudrun all, and she is mocking me even now!"

"The tale begins," said Regin.  "Hreidmar was my father's name, amighty man and z wealthy: and his first son was named Fafnir, hissecond Otter, and I was the third, and the least of them all bothfor prowess and good conditions, but I was cunning to work iniron, and silver, and gold, whereof I could make matters thatavailed somewhat.  Other skill my brother Otter followed, and hadanother nature withal, for he was a great fisher, and above othermen herein; in that he had the likeness of an otter by day, anddwelt ever in the river, and bare fish to bank in his mouth, andhis prey would he ever bring to our father, and that availed himmuch: for the most part he kept him in his otter-gear, and thenhe would come home, and eat alone, and slumbering, for on the dryland he might see naught.  But Fafnir was by far the greatest andgrimmest, and would have all things about called his."Now," says Regin, "there was a dwarf called Andvari, who everabode in that force, (1) which was called Andvari's force, in thelikeness of a pike, and got meat for himself, for many fish therewere in the force; now Otter, my brother, was ever wont to enterinto the force, and bring fish aland, and lay them one by one onthe bank.  And so it befell that Odin, Loki, and Hoenir, as theywent their ways, came to Andvari's force, and Otter had taken asalmon, and ate it slumbering upon the river bank; then Loki tooka stone and cast it at Otter, so that he gat his death thereby;the gods were well content with their prey, and fell to flayingoff the otter's skin; and in the evening they came to Hreidmar'shouse, and showed him what they had taken: thereon he laid handson them, and doomed them to such ransom, as that they should fillthe otter skin with gold, and cover it over without with redgold; so they sent Loki to gather gold together for them; he cameto Ran, (2) and got her net, and went therewith to Andvari'sforce, and cast the net before the pike, and the pike ran intothe net and was taken.  Then said Loki --"`What fish of all fishes,Swims strong in the flood,But hath learnt little wit to beware?Thine head must thou buy,From abiding in hell,And find me the wan waters flame.'"He answered --"`Andvari folk call me,Call Oinn my father,Over many a force have I fared;For a Norn of ill-luck,This life on me layThrough wet ways ever to wade.'"So Loki beheld the gold of Andvari, and when he had given up thegold, he had but one ring left, and that also Loki took from him;then the dwarf went into a hollow of the rocks, and cried out,that that gold-ring, yea and all the gold withal, should be thebane of every man who should own it thereafter."Now the gods rode with the treasure to Hreidmar, and fulfilledthe otter-skin, and set it on its feet, and they must cover itover utterly with gold: but when this was done then Hreidmar cameforth, and beheld yet one of the muzzle hairs, and bade themcover that withal; then Odin drew the ring, Andvari's loom, fromhis hand, and covered up the hair therewith; then sang Loki --"`Gold enow, gold enow,A great weregild, thou hast,That my head in good hap I may hold;But thou and thy sonAre naught fated to thrive,The bane shall it be of you both.'"Thereafter," says Regin, "Fafnir slew his father and murderedhim, nor got I aught of the treasure, and so evil he grew, thathe fell to lying abroad, and begrudged any share in the wealth toany man, and so became the worst of all worms, and ever now liesbrooding upon that treasure: but for me, I went to the king andbecame his master-smith; and thus is the tale told of how I lostthe heritage of my father, and the weregild for my brother."So spake Regin; but since that time gold is called Ottergild, andfor no other cause than this.But Sigurd answered, "Much hast thou lost, and exceeding evilhave thy kinsmen been!  But now, make a sword by thy craft, sucha sword as that none can be made like unto it; so that I may dogreat deeds therewith, if my heart avail thereto, and thouwouldst have me slay this mighty dragon."Regin says, "Trust me well herein; and with that same sword shaltthou slay Fafnir."

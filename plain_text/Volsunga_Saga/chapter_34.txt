Now tells the tale that on a night King Atli woke from sleep andspake to Gudrun --"Medreamed," said he, "that thou didst thrust me through with asword."Then Gudrun areded the dream, and said that it betokened fire,whenas folk dreamed of iron.  "It befalls of thy pride belike, inthat thou deemest thyself the first of men,"Atli said, "Moreover I dreamed that here waxed two sorb-tree (1)saplings, and fain I was that they should have no scathe of me;then these were riven up by the roots and reddened with blood,and borne to the bench, and I was bidden eat thereof."Yea, yet again I dreamed that two hawks flew from my hand hungryand unfed, and fared to hell, and meseemed their hearts weremingled with honey, and that I ate thereof."And then again I dreamed that two fair whelps lay before meyelling aloud, and that the flesh of them I ate, though my willwent not with the eating."Gudrun says, "Nowise good are these dreams, yet shall they cometo pass; surely thy sons are nigh to death, and many heavy thingsshall fall upon us.""Yet again I dreamed," said he, "and methought I lay in a bath,and folk took counsel to slay me."Now these things wear away with time, but in nowise was theirlife together fond.Now falls Atli to thinking of where may be gotten that plenteousgold which Sigurd had owned, but King Gunnar and his brethrenwere lords thereof now.Atli was a great king and mighty, wise, and a lord of many men;and now he falls to counsel with his folk as to the ways of them.He wotted well that Gunnar and his brethren had more wealth thanany others might have, and so he falls to the rede of sending mento them, and bidding them to a great feast, and honouring them indiverse wise, and the chief of those messengers was hight Vingi.Now the queen wots of their conspiring, and misdoubts her thatthis would mean some beguiling of her brethren: so she cut runes,and took a gold ring, and knit therein a wolf's hair, and gave itinto the hands of the king's messengers.Thereafter they go their ways according to the king's bidding:and or ever they came aland Vingi beheld the runes, and turnedthem about in such wise as if Gudrun prayed her brethren in herrunes to go meet King Atli.Thereafter they came to the hall of King Gunnar, and had goodwelcome at his hands, and great fires were made for them, and ingreat joyance they drank of the best of drink.Then spake Vingi, "King Atli sends me hither, and is fain that yego to his house and home in all glory, and take of him exceedinghonours, helms and shields, swords and byrnies, gold and goodlyraiment, horses, hosts of war, and great and wide lands, for,saith he, he is fainest of all things to bestow his realm andlordship upon you."Then Gunnar turned his head aside, and spoke to Hogni --"In what wise shall we take this bidding?  Might and wealth hebids us take; but no kings know I who have so much gold as wehave, whereas we have all the hoard which lay once on Gnitaheath;and great are our chambers, and full of gold, and weapons forsmiting, and all kinds of raiment of war, and well I wot thatamidst all men my horse is the best, and my sword the sharpestand my gold the most glorious."Hogni answers, "A marvel is it to me of his bidding, for seldomhath he done in such a wise, and ill counselled will it be towend to him; lo now, when I saw those dear-bought things the kingsends us I wondered to behold a wolfs hair knit to a certain goldring; belike Gudrun deems him to be minded as a wolf towards us,and will have naught of our faring."But withal Vingi shows him the runes which he said Gudrun hadsent.Now the most of folk go to bed, but these drank on still withcertain others; and Kostbera, the wife of Hogni, the fairest ofwomen, came to them, and looked on the runes.But the wife of Gunnar was Glaumvor, a great hearted wife.So these twain poured out, and the kings drank and were exceedingdrunken, and Vingi notes it, and says --"Naught may I hide that King Atli is heavy of foot and over-oldfor the warding of his realm; but his sons are young and of noaccount: now will he give you rule over his realms while they areyet thus young, and most fain will he be that ye have the joythereof before all others."Now so it befell both that Gunnar was drunk, and that dominionwas held out to him, nor might he work against the fate shapenfor him; so he gave his word to go, and tells Hogni his brotherthereof.But he answered, "Thy word given must even stand now, nor will Ifail to follow thee, but most loth am I to journey."

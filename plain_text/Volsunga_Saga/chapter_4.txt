Now it is to be told that Siggeir goes to bed by Signy thatnight, and the next morning the weather was fair; then says KingSiggeir that he will not bide, lest the wind should wax, or thesea grow impassable; nor is it said that Volsung or his sonsletted him herein, and that the less, because they saw that hewas fain to get him gone from the feast.  But now says Signy toher father --"I have no will to go away with Seggeir, neither does my heartsmile upon him, and I wot, by my fore-knowledge, and from thefetch (1) of our kin, that from this counsel will great evil fallon us if this wedding be not speedily undone.""Speak in no such wise, daughter!" said he, "for great shame willit be to him, yea, and to us also, to break troth with him, hebeing sackless; (2) and in naught may we trust him, and nofriendship shall we have of him, if these matters are broken off;but he will pay us back in as evil wise as he may; for that aloneis seemly, to hold truly to troth given."So King Siggeir got ready for home, and before he went from thefeast he bade King Volsung, his father-in-las, come see him inGothland, and all his sons with him whenas three months should beoverpast, and to bring such following with him, as he would have,and as he deemed meet for his honour; and thereby will Siggeirthe king pay back for the shortcomings of the wedding-feast, inthat he would abide thereat but one night only, a thing notaccording to the wont of men.  So King Volsung gave word to comeon the day named, and the kinsmen-in-law parted, and Siggeir wenthome with his wife.

By long roads rides Sigurd, till he comes at the last up on toHindfell, and wends his way south to the land of the Franks; andhe sees before him on the fell a great light, as of fire burning,and flaming up even unto the heavens; and when he came thereto,lo, a shield hung castle before him, and a banner on the topmost thereof: into the castle went Sigurd, and saw one lying thereasleep, and all-armed.  Therewith he takes the helm from off thehead of him, and sees that it is no man, but a woman; and she wasclad in a byrny as closely set on her as though it had gown toher flesh; so he rent it from the collar downwards; and then thesleeves thereof, and ever the sword bit on it as if it werecloth.  Then said Sigurd that over-long had she lain asleep; butshe asked --"What thing of great might is it that has prevailed to rend mybyrny, and draw me from my sleep?"Even as sings the song   (1)"What bit on the byrny,Why breaks my sleep away,Who has turned from meMy wan tormenting?""Ah, is it so, that here is come Sigurd Sigmundson, bearingFafnir's helm on his head and Fafnir's bane in his hand?"Then answered Sigurd --"Sigmund's sonWith Sigurd's swordE'en now rent downThe raven's wall.""Of the Volsung's kin is he who has done the deed; but now I haveheard that thou art daughter of a mighty king, and folk have toldus that thou wert lovely and full of lore, and now I will try thesame."Then Brynhild sang --"Long have I sleptAnd slumbered long,Many and long are the woes of mankind,By the might of OdinMust I bide helplessTo shake from off me the spells of slumber."Hail to the day come back!Hail, sons of the daylight!Hail to thee, dark night, and thy daughter!Look with kind eyes a-down,On us sitting here lonely,And give unto us the gain that we long for."Hail to the Aesir,And the sweet Asyniur! (2)Hail to the fair earth fulfilled of plenty!Fair words, wise hearts,Would we win from you,And healing hands while life we hold."Then Brynhild speaks again and says, "Two kings fought, one hightHelm Gunnar, an old man, and the greatest of warriors, and Odinhad promised the victory unto him; but his foe was Agnar, orAudi's brother, and so I smote down Helm Gunnar in the fight; andOdin, in vengeance for that deed, stuck the sleep-thorn into me,and said that I should never again have the victory, but shouldbe given away in marriage; but there against I vowed a vow, thatnever would I wed one who knew the name of fear."Then said Sigurd, "Teach us the lore of mighty matters!"She said, "Belike thou cannest more skill in all than I; yet willI teach thee; yea, and with thanks, if there be aught of mycunning that will in anywise pleasure thee, either of runes or ofother matters that are the root of things; but now let us drinktogether, and may the Gods give to us twain a good day, that thoumayst win good help and fame from my wisdom, and that thou maysthereafter mind thee of that which we twain speak together."Then Brynhild filled a beaker and bore it to Sigurd, and gave himthe drink of love, and spake --"Beer bring I to thee,Fair fruit of the byrnies' clash,Mixed is it mightily,Mingled with fame,Brimming with bright laysAnd pitiful runes,Wise words, sweet words,Speech of great game."Runes of war know thou,If great thou wilt be!Cut them on hilt of hardened sword,Some on the brand's back,Some on its shining side,Twice name Tyr therein."Sea-runes good at need,Learnt for ship's saving,For the good health of the swimming horse;On the stern cut them,Cut them on the rudder-bladeAnd set flame to shaven oar:Howso big be the sea-hills,Howso blue beneath,Hail from the main then comest thou home."Word-runes learn wellIf thou wilt that no manPay back grief for the grief thou gavest;Wind thou these,Weave thou these,Cast thou these all about thee,At the Thing,Where folk throng,Unto the full doom faring."Of ale-runes know the wisdomIf thou wilt that another's wifeShould not bewray thine heart that trusteth:Cut them on the mead-horn,On the back of each hand,And nick an N upon thy nail."Ale have thou heedTo sign from all harmLeek lay thou in the liquor,Then I know for sureNever cometh to thee,Mead with hurtful matters mingled."Help-runes shalt thou gatherIf skill thou wouldst gainTo loosen child from low-laid mother;Cut be they in hands hollow,Wrapped the joints round about;Call for the Good-folks' gainsome helping."Learn the bough-runes wisdomIf leech-lore thou lovest;And wilt wot about wounds' searchingOn the bark be they scored;On the buds of treesWhose boughs look eastward ever."Thought-runes shalt thou deal withIf thou wilt be of all menFairest-souled wight, and wisest,These arededThese first cutThese first took to heart high Hropt."On the shield were they scoredThat stands before the shining God,On Early-waking's ear,On All-knowing's hoof,On the wheel which runnethUnder Rognir's chariot;On Sleipnir's jaw-teeth,On the sleigh's traces."On the rough bear's paws,And on Bragi's tongue,On the wolfs claws,And on eagle's bill,On bloody wings,And bridge's end;On loosing palms,And pity's path:"On glass, and on gold,And on goodly silver,In wine and in wort,And the seat of the witch-wife;On Gungnir's point,And Grani's bosom;On the Norn's nail,And the neb of the night-owl."All these so cut,Were shaven and sheared,And mingled in with holy mead,And sent upon wide ways enow;Some abide with the Elves,Some abide with the Aesir,Or with the wise Vanir,Some still hold the sons of mankind."These be the book-runes,And the runes of good help,And all the ale-runes,And the runes of much might;To whomso they may avail,Unbewildered unspoilt;They are wholesome to have:Thrive thou with these then.When thou hast learnt their lore,Till the Gods end thy life-days."Now shalt thou choose theeE'en as choice is bidden,Sharp steel's root and stem,Choose song or silence;See to each in thy heart,All hurt has been heeded."Then answered Sigurd --"Ne'er shall I flee,Though thou wottest me fey;Never was I born for blenching,Thy loved rede will IHold aright in my heartEven as long as I may live."

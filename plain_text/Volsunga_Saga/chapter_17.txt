Now Sigurd went to the kings, and spake thus --"Here have I abode a space with you, and I owe you thanks andreward, for great love and many gifts and all due honour; but nowwill I away from the land and go meet the sons of Hunding, and dothem to wit that the Volsungs are not all dead; and your mightwould I have to strengthen me therein."So the kings said that they would give him all things soever thathe desired, and therewith was a great army got ready, and allthings wrought in the most heedful wise, ships and all war-gear,so that his journey might be of the stateliest: but Sigurdhimself steered the dragon-keel which was the greatest andnoblest; richly wrought were their sails, and glorious to lookon.So they sail and have wind at will; but when a few days wereoverpast, there arose a great storm on the sea, and the waveswere to behold even as the foam of men's blood; but Sigurd badetake in no sail, howsoever they might be riven, but rather to layon higher than heretofore.  But as they sailed past the rocks ofa ness, a certain man hailed the ships, and asked who was captainover that navy; then was it told him that the chief and lord wasSigurd, the son of Sigmund, the most famed of all the young menwho now are.Then said the man, "Naught but one thing, certes do all say ofhim, that none among the sons of kings may be likened unto him;now fain were I that ye would shorten sail on some of the ships,and take me aboard."Then they asked him of his name, and he sang --"Hnikar I hight,When I gladdened Huginn,And went to battle,Bright son of Volsung;Now may ye callThe carl on the cliff top,Feng or Fjolnir:Fain would I with you."They made for land therewith, and took that man aboard.Then quoth Sigurd,(1) as the song says --"Tell me this, O Hnikar,Since full well thou knowestFate of Gods, good and ill of mankind,What best our hap foresheweth,When amid the battleAbout us sweeps the sword edge."Quoth Hnikar --"Good are many tokensIf thereof men wottedWhen the swords are sweeping:Fair fellow deem IThe dark-winged raven,In war, to weapon-wielder."The second good thing:When abroad thou goestFor the long road well arrayed,Good if thou seestTwo men standing,Fain of fame within the forecourt."A third thing:Good hearing,The wolf a howlingAbroad under ash boughs;Good hap shalt thou haveDealing with helm-staves,If thou seest these fare before thee."No man in fightHis face shall turnAgainst the moon's sisterLow, late-shining,For he winneth battleWho best beholdethThrough the midmost sword-play,And the sloping ranks best shapeth."Great is the troubleOf foot ill-tripping,When arrayed for fight thou farest,For on both sides aboutAre the Disir (2) by thee,Guileful, wishful of thy wounding."Fair-combed, well washenLet each warrior be,Nor lack meat in the morning,For who can ruleThe eve's returning,And base to fall before fate grovelling."Then the storm abated, and on they fared till they came aland inthe realm of Hunding's sons, and then Fjolnir vanished away.Then they let loose fire and sword, and slew men and burnt theirabodes, and did waste all before them: a great company of folkfled before the face of them to Lyngi the King, and tell him thatmen of war are in the land, and are faring with such rage andfury that the like has never been heard of; and that the sons ofKing Hunding had no great forecast in that they said they wouldnever fear the Volsungs more, for here was come Sigurd, the sonof Sigmund, as captain over this army.So King Lyngi let send the war-message all throughout his realm,and has no will to flee, but summons to him all such as wouldgive him aid.  So he came against Sigurd with a great army, heand his brothers with him, and an exceeding fierce fight befell;many a spear and many an arrow might men see there raised aloft,axes hard driven, shields cleft and byrnies torn, helmets wereshivered, skulls split atwain, and many a man felled to the coldearth.And now when the fight has long dured in such wise, Sigurd goesforth before the banners, and has the good sword Gram in hishand, and smites down both men and horses, and goes through thethickest of the throng with both arms red with blood to theshoulder; and folk shrank aback before him wheresoever he went,nor would either helm or byrny hold before him, and no man deemedhe had ever seen his like.  So a long while the battle lasted,and many a man was slain, and furious was the onset; till at lastit befell, even as seldom comes to hand, when a land army fallson, that, do whatso they might, naught was brought about; but somany men fell of the sons of Hunding that the tale of them maynot be told; and now whenas Sigurd was among the foremost, camethe sons of Hunding against him, and Sigurd smote therewith atLyngi the king, and clave him down, both helm and head, and mail-clad body, and thereafter he smote Hjorward his brother atwain,and then slew all the other sons of Hunding who were yet alive,and the more part of their folk withal.Now home goes Sigurd with fair victory won, and plenteous wealthand great honour, which he had gotten to him in this journey, andfeasts were made for him against he came back to the realm.But when Sigurd had been at home but a little, came Regin to talkwith him, and said --"Belike thou wilt now have good will to bow down Fafnir's crestaccording to thy word plighted, since thou hast thus revenged thyfather and the others of thy kin."Sigurd answered, "That will we hold to, even as we have promised,nor did it ever fall from our memory."

IIISo then great sorrow Healfdene's sonContinually suffered: might not the wise chieftainHis woes remove: too great was that pain,Loathsome and lasting, that came on the people,Dreadful distress, greatest of night-bales.That from home learnt Higelac's thane,Good 'mong the Geats, the deeds of Grendel;He was of mankind strongest in mightIn the day then of this mortal life,Noble and great. For him a ship bade heA good one prepare, quoth, he the war-kingOver the swan-road wished to seek out,The mighty prince, since he need had of men.That journey to him the cunning churlsNot at all blamed, though he lear to them was.They whetted the brave one, good omens they sawThe good one had of the Geats' peopleWarriors chosen, of those whom he bravestWas able to find: one of fifteenThe vessel he sought: a warrior made known,A sea-crafty man, the neighboring landmarks.Thus time went on: on the waves was the ship,Boat under the mountain. The heroes readyOn the prow stied: the billows rolledThe sea 'gainst the sand. The warriors boreOn the deck of the ship ornaments bright,Equipments ornate: the men shoved out,Men on willing journey, the well-fitted wood.Went then o'er the waves, by the wind hastened,The foamy-necked float to a fowl most like,Till at the same hour of the following dayThe curv√©d prow had traversed the water.So that the sailors then saw the land,The sea-cliffs shine, the mountains steep,The broad sea-nesses. Then was the sea-goerAt the end of its voyage. Thence quickly upThe Weders' people on the plain stied,The sea-wood tied, their battle-sarks rattled,Their weeds of war: thanked they then GodThat for them the sea-paths easy were found.Then saw from the wall the guard of the Scyldings,He who the sea-cliffs was set to hold,Bear o'er the bulwarks bright-looking shields,Weapons ready for war: wonder aroused himIn his mind's thoughts as to what these men were.Went he then to the sea on his steed riding,The thane of Hrothgar; with might he shookThe strong wood in his hands, with formal words spoke:"What now are ye of arms-bearing menWith burnies protected, who thus a high keelOver the sea-path bringing have comeO'er the waves hither, clad in helmets?I was the coast-guard, sea-watch I keptThat no one of foes on the Danes' landWith a ship-army injury might do.Not here more openly ever have comeBearers of shields! Ye the permissionOf warlike men did not well know,Consent of kinsmen ! Ne'er saw I a greaterEarl upon earth than is one of you,A hero in armor: that is no home-stayerWith weapons adorned, unless looks belie him,His peerless appearance. Now I of you shallThe origin learn, ere ye far hence,Like to false spies, in the land of the DanesFurther advance. Now ye far-dwelling,Sea-faring men, give willing earTo my simple thought: haste now is bestTo make plainly known whence is your coming.'

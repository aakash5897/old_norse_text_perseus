XXIVBeowulf then spoke, Ecgtheow's son:"Lo! we thee this sea-booty, son of Healfdene,Prince of the Scyldings, with joy have broughtAs a token of fame, which thou gazest on here.I that with my life scarcely escaped;Under water in battle risked I the workWith great exertion; almost would have beenEnded the struggle, had not me God shielded.I might not in battle with Hrunting the swordAught then perform, though that weapon is good:But the Ruler of men granted to meThat I on the wall saw beautiful hangingAn old mighty sword (often has He directedThose without friends), that I brandished the weapon.Then I slew in the contest, when time favored me,The house's keepers. Then did the battle-bill,The etched brand, burn, as sprang forth the blood,The hottest of battle-gore: I the hilt thenceBore from my foes, avenged their ill-deeds,Death-plague of the Danes, as it was right.I promise thee then that thou mayest in Heorot,Sorrowless sleep with thy warrior-band,And each of the thanes of thine own people,Of old and of young; thou needst not for them fear,Chief of the Scyldings, from this directionLife-bale for thy earls, as thou didst before,"Then was the golden hilt to the old warrior,The hoary war-chief, given in hand,The old work of giants: it went into the keeping,Since the fall of the devils, of the lord of the Danes,The cunning smiths' work, when this world forsookThe bad-hearted being, the opposer of God.Devoted to death, and his mother also.It went into the power of the noblest oneOf the world-kings by the two seas,Of those who in Sceden-ig treasure divided.Hrothgar then spoke, on the hilt looked,The old relic on which was the origin writtenOf an old contest: the flood afterwards slew,The rushing sea, the race of the giants;Badly they fared: that people was hostileTo the Lord eternal; therefor a rewardThrough waters' flood the Almighty them gave.So was on the guard of purest goldIn runic letters rightly engraved,Was set and said, for whom that sword,Choicest of weapons, first had been wroughtWith wreathed hilt snake-adorned. Then the chief spoke,The son of Healfdene (kept silent all):"Lo! that he may say who truth and rightWorks for his people, the past all remembers,An old home-guardian, that this earl wasOne born of the best. Thy fame is wide-spreadThrough distant ways, Beowulf my friend,Over each nation: with patience thou holdest it all,Thy might with prudence of mind. I shall to thee grantMy friendship, as we before spoke: thou shalt be for comfort,All long-assured, to thine own people,To heroes for help. Not so was HeremodTo the children of Ecgwela, the Honor-Scyldings;He throve not for their pleasure, but for their slaughter,And for death-plagues to the Danes' people:Slew he enraged his table-companions,His chosen comrades, till he went alone,The mighty prince, from human joys:Though him mighty God in joy of strength.In power exalted, over all menHim had uplifted, yet in his heart grewA bloodthirsty feeling: he did not give ringsTo the Danes by right: joyless abode he,So that for this strife sorrow he suffered,Misery lasting. By that teach thou thyself,Practise man's virtues. This tale for theeHave I, old in years, told. 'Tis a wonder to sayHow mighty God to the race of mankind,Through His great mind, wisdom divides,Homes and nobility: He rules over all.Sometimes on love permits He to turnThe thoughts of the man of mighty race,Gives him in his home the joy of earth,A sheltering city of men to possess,Makes subject to him parts of the world,A kingdom wide, so that he of it may not,For his lack of wisdom, think of the end:He dwells in plenty, nor him does aught check,Sickness nor age, nor for him does sorrowGrow dark in his mind, nor a foe anywhereShow him sword-hate, but for him all the worldWends at his will. He knows not the worse,

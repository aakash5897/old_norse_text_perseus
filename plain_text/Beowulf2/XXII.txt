XXIIBeowulf then spoke, Ecgtheow's son:"Bethink thyself now, great kinsman of HealfdeneThou ruler wise, now I'm for the way ready,Gold-friend of men, of what we once spoke,If I in thy service should at any timeOf my life be deprived, that thou wouldst ever beTo me when gone hence, in stead of a father.Be thou a protector to my knightly thanes,My trusty comrades, if war take me off:Also the treasures, which thou gavest me,Do thou, dear Hrothgar, to Hygelac send.May then by the gold the Geat's lord perceive,Hrethel's son see, when he looks on the treasure,That I did one find in man's virtues good,A giver of rings, him enjoyed while I might.And do thou let Hunferth the ancient relic,The wonderful sword, the widely-known manThe hard-edged have. I shall with HruntingFame for me gain, or death will me take."After these words the prince of the Weder-GeatsHastened with valor, not for an answerWould he await. The water-flood tookThe mighty warrior: then was a day's spaceEre the bottom-plain he might perceive.Soon that discovered she who the flood's realm,Eager for blood, for fifty years held,Grim and greedy, that there some one of menThe monster's abode sought out from above.She grasped then against him, the warrior seizedIn her terrible claws; not sooner she injuredHis body sound: the burnie him shielded,So that she might not pierce through the corslet,The locked linked sark, with fiendish fingers.Bore then the sea-wolf, when she came to the bottom,The giver of rings to her own abode,So that he might not, tho' he was brave,His weapons wield, but him many strange onesOppressed in the sea: many a sea-beastWith battle-tusks his war-sark brake;The monsters harassed him. The earl then perceivedThat he in sea-hall, he knew not what, was,Where him no water in aught might harm,Nor for the roofed hall might lay hold of himSudden grip of the flood: the fire-light he saw,The brilliant beams brightly shining.The good one perceived then the wolf of the bottom,The mighty mere-woman; he gave a strong strokeWith his battle-bill, withheld not the blow,So that on her head the ringed blade soundedA greedy war-song. Then the stranger perceivedThat the war-weapon would not cleave through,Injure her life, but the edge failedThe prince in his need: before it enduredMany hand-meetings, the helmet oft clave,The fated one's corslet: that was the first timeTo the dear treasure that power had failed.Again was determined, not lacking in prowess,Mindful of fame, the kinsman of Hygelac:Then threw the etched brand, with jewels adorned,The angry warrior, that it on the earth lay,Strong and steel-edged; he trusted to strength,The hand-grip of might: so shall a man do,When he in war thinketh to gainPraise everlasting, nor for his life careth.Seized then by the shoulder (cared she not for the contest)The War-Geats' prince Grendel's mother,Threw then battle-brave, for he was enraged,The life-destroyer, that she on the floor fell.She him again quickly the hand-grip repaidWith her fierce claws, and seized him fast:Then stumbled the weary one, strongest of warriors.The fighter-on-foot, so that he fell.She sat on the hall-guest and drew her short sword.Broad and brown-edged, her son would avenge,Her only child. On his shoulder layThe braided breast-net: that his life saved,Against point and edge entrance withstood.Then had he perished, Ecgtheow's son,'Neath the broad bottom, the chief of the GeatsHad not the war-burnie lent help to him,The hard battle-net, and had not holy GodDirected the victory, the all-knowing Lord;The Ruler of heaven adjudged it aright;Easily afterwards he again rose.

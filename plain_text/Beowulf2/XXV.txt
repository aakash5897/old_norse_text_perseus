Care not for pride,Mighty warrior. Now is thy strength's fameLasting a while: soon after it shall beThat sickness or sword shall rob thee of might,Or clutch of the fire, or swell of the flood,Or grip of the sword, or flight of the arrow,Or fearful old age, or light of the eyesShall fail and grow dark: it suddenly shall beThat thee, great warrior, death shall overcome.So I the Ring-Danes a hundred half-yearsRuled under heavens, and secured them by warAgainst many tribes throughout this mid-earth,With spears and with swords, so that any foeUnder circuit of heaven reckoned I not.Lo! to me in my home a change of this came,Sorrow for joy, after Grendel becameThe foe of long years, my constant home-seeker:I from this hostility continually sufferedMuch sorrow of mind.

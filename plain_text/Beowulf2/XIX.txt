XIXThey went then to sleep: one sorely paid forHis evening-rest, as to them often happenedWhen the gold-hall Grendel in-dwelt,Evil deeds wrought, until the end came,Death for his crimes. That became plain,To men widely known, that still an avengerLived for his foes. For a long timeAfter the war-sorrow Grendel's mother,A terrible woman, nourished her grief,Who was said to inhabit the fearful waters,The ice-cold streams, since Cain becameThe murderer by sword of his only brother,His father's son; then outlawed he went,With murder marked, to flee human joy,Dwelt in the waste. Thence many sprangOf the demons of fate; of these one was Grendel,Hateful and ravenous, who in Heorot foundA watching man awaiting the battleWhere the fell monster him was attacking:Yet he remembered the strength of his might,The powerful gift, which God to him gave,And on the Lord's favor relied for himselfFor comfort and help: so the fiend overcame he,Felled the demon of hell, when he humbled departed,Deprived of joy, his death-place to see,The foe of mankind. And still his mother,Greedy and raging, wished then to goThe sorrowful journey her son to avenge.She came then to Heorot, where the Ring-DanesThrough the hall slept: then there was soonA change to the earls, when within enteredGrendel's-mother. The terror was lessEven by so much as is woman's strength,A woman's war-terror, esteemed by a man,When a bound sword, forged by the hammer,The sword stained with gore, the boar on the helmet,Strong in its edges, opposite cleaves.Then was in the hall the hard-edged drawn,The sword o'er the seats, many a broad shieldRaised firm in hand: of helmet one thought not,Of burnie broad, when terror him seized.She was in haste, would thence away,Her life preserve, when she was discovered.Quickly had she of one of the warriorsFirmly laid hold, when she to fen went:He was to Hrothgar, the dearest of menIn the office of comrade by the two seas,A shield-warrior strong, whom she in rest killed,A hero renowned. Not there was Beowulf,But other room before was assigned,After the treasure-giving, to the great Geat.Noise was in Heorot: she in its gore tookThe well-known hand. Grief was renewedAgain in the dwellings; 'twas not a good trade,That they on both sides payment should makeWith the lives of their friends. Then was the old king,The hoary warrior, in sorrowful mood,When he his chief thane, deprived of life,The dearest one, knew to be dead.Quickly was Beowulf brought to the hall,The victory-blest hero. At dawn of dayWent one of earls, the noble warrior,Himself with his comrades, where the wise oneawaited,Whether for him the Almighty will ever,After this woe-spell, a change of things work.Went then on the floor the man war-renownedWith his band of men (the hall-wood resounded),Until he addressed the wise one in words,The lord of the Ingwins, asked if to him were,As he had wished, the night undisturbed.

XXXVIIIThen heard I that quickly Weohstan's son,After these words, his wounded lordSick from battle obeyed, bore his ringed net,His battle-sark woven, 'neath the roof of the mountainSaw then victorious, when he by the seat went,The brave kin-thane many of treasures.Glittering gold on the ground lying,Wonder on wall and the den of the worm,The old air-flier, drinking-cups standing,Vessels of old-time wanting the polisher,Deprived of their ornaments. There was many a helmetOld and rusty, many arm-braceletsCuriously twisted. The treasure may easily,The gold in the ground, each hoard of mankindIn value exceed, let him hide it who will.Likewise he saw standing an all-golden bannerHigh over the hoard, greatest of wonders,Wrought with hand-craft; from it light stood,So that the ground-plain he might perceive,Examine the treasures. There was not of the serpentAny appearance, but sword took him off.Then I heard say, in the cave the hoard robbed,The old work of giants, one man alone,Bore on his bosom the cups and the platesAt his own will; the banner he took,Brightest of beacons, a bill sheathed with brass(Its edge was of iron) of the old lord,Who of these treasures was the protectorFor a long while, bore fiery terrorHot, deadly-rolling, on account of the hoardIn the midst of the night, till he in death perished.In haste was the messenger for return ready,Provided with treasures; wonder him moved,Whether he the high-minded alive would findIn that grassy spot, the prince of the Weders,Deprived of strength, where he him before left.He then with the treasures the mighty prince,His own dear lord, bleeding did findAt the end of his life. He began him againWith water to sprinkle, until the word's pointBrake through his breast-hoard: Beowulf spoke,The old man in sorrow (the gold he viewed):"I for these treasures to the Lord of all thanks,To the glorious King, in words do speak,To the Lord eternal, - which I here look upon,For this that I might for mine own peopleBefore my death-day such treasures obtain.Now I for the hoard of jewels have paidMine own aged life; do ye now supplyThe needs of my people; I may not longer be hereBid ye the war-famed a mound to makeBright after the pyre at the sea's point,Which shall for remembrance to mine own peopleRaise itself high on the Whale's ness,That it the sea-farers hereafter may callBeowulf's mound, who shall their high shipsO'er the sea's mists from afar drive."He put from his neck the golden ring,The bold-minded prince, gave to the thane,The young spear-warrior, his gold-adorned helm,Collar and burnie, bade him use them well:"Thou art the last left of our own kindredOf the Waegmundings. Weird carried away allOf mine own kinsmen at the time appointed,Earls in their strength: I shall go after them."That was to the aged the very last wordIn his breast-thoughts, ere the pyre he chose,The hot fiery waves: from his breast wentHis soul to seek the doom of the saints.

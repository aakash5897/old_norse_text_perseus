XXXIINot at all of free-will the dragon-hoard's heapSought he of himself, who him sorely injured,But through necessity the thane of some oneOf the children of men hateful blows fled,Through dire compulsion, and therein enteredThe innocent man. Soon it was at that timeThat there to the stranger dread terror stood:Yet miserable he there within took,The frightened soul who terror suffered,A costly-wrought vessel. There were many of suchIn the earth-cave, of ancient treasures,As them in old days some one of men,The great bequest of a noble race,With thoughtful mind there had concealed,The precious treasures. Death them all took awayIn former times, and the only one stillOf the people's nobles who there longest lived,The friend-mourning guardian, wished that to delaySo that he a short time longer the treasuresMight there enjoy. A mountain all readyStood on the plain near to the waters,Steep by the ness, firm, inaccessible:There within bore of noble treasuresThe keeper of rings a part hard to carryOf beaten gold, banning words spoke:"Keep thou now, earth, since men may not,The possession of earls. Lo! before it in theeGood men obtained: war-death took away,Fearful life-bale, each one of men,Of mine own people, who gave up this life:They saw hall-joy. I've not one to bear sword.Or care for the cup of beaten gold,The dear drinking-vessel: the chiefs elsewhere are gone.The hard helmet shall, with gold adorned,Be deprived of its jewels: the polishers sleep,Those who the battle-mask should ever brighten;And likewise the breast-plate, which in battle enduredO'er clash of shields the blows of weapons,Crumbles after the warrior: nor may the ringed burnieAfter the battle-chief go far and wideBy the side of heroes: there 's no harp's joy,Play of the glee-wood, nor does the good hawkThrough the hall fly, nor the swift horseThe city-courts paw. Mighty death hasMany of mortals sent on their way."So sad in mind in sorrow mournedOne over all, miserable lived heBy day and night, until death's waveTouched him at heart. The precious hoard foundThe old twilight-foe open standing,He who burning the mountains seeks,The naked dragon, who flies by nightSurrounded by fire: him the earth-dwellersSaw from afar. He shall inhabitThe hedge on the earth, where he heathen goldGuards old in years: he shall not be the better.So the folk-foe three hundred wintersHeld in the earth one of hoard-hallsWondrously great, until him one angered,A man, in his mind: he bore to his lordThe jewelled cup, a peace-offering gaveTo his own lord. Then was the hoard found,Hoard of rings borne away; the prayer was grantedTo the miserable man: his lord beheldMen's ancient work for the first time.When the dragon awoke, strife was renewed:He went 'round o'er the stone, the brave-minded foundHis enemy's foot-track: he forth had steppedWith secret craft near the head of the dragon.So may one not fated easily escapeWoes and exile, who the Almighty'sFavor possesses. The hoard-keeper soughtO'er the ground eagerly, would find the man,Who to him in sleep this harm had done:Hot and fierce-minded oft he went 'round the caveNow all without: there was not any manOn the heath's waste. Yet in battle he joyed,In hostile deeds: he returned to the mountain,The precious cup sought: he that soon found,That some one of men the gold had discovered,The costly treasures. The hoard-keeper waited,Angry in mind, until evening came:Was then enraged the guard of the mountain,Would many people with fire repayFor the dear drinking-cup. Then was the day goneAt the will of the dragon, nor in the cave longerWould he abide, but with flame went he forth,With fire provided. The beginning was fearfulTo the folk in the land, as it too quicklyOn their ring-giver sorely was ended.

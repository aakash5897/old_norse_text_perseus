XXVIICame then to the sea the very brave ones,The band of attendants; their burnies they bore,Their locked body-sarks. The land-guard perceivedThe return of the earls, as he before did:He did not with harm from the cliff's headGreet then the guests, but towards them rode,Quoth that as welcome the Weders' people,The mail-clad warriors, went to their ship.Then was on the shore the spacious boat,The ring-prowed ship, with battle-weeds laden,With horses and jewels; the mast aroseOver Hrothgar's hoard of treasures.He to the boat-guard, bound with gold-work,A sword then gave, so that after he wasOn the mead-bench from the jewel more honored,The costly heir-loom. He went in his sea-boatTo stir the deep water, the Danes' land forsook.Then was to the mast one of sea-cloths,Sail by rope fastened. The vessel groaned;Not there the sea-floater did the wind o'er the wavesIn its course hinder: the sea-goer went,The foamy-necked floated forth o'er the water,The curv√©d-prowed went o'er the sea-waves,Until the Geats' cliffs they might descry,The well-known nesses. The keel pressed up,Urged by the wind it stood on the land.Quickly was at the sea the harbor-guard ready,Who long time before for the dear menLonging had gazed afar on the ocean:He to the shore fastened the wide-bosomed shipWith anchor-chains fast, lest the waves' forceThe winsome boat might carry away.He bade then bear up the nobles' treasures,Jewels and beaten gold; not for them far thenceWas it to seek the giver of rings:Hygelac, Hrethel's son, there at home dwelt,Himself with his comrades near the sea-wall.The building was fine, the prince a good king,High was the hall, Hygd very young,Wise, well-instructed, although winters fewUnder the city-locks she may have dwelt,The daughter of Haereth: she was not, though, niggardly,Nor sparing in gifts, to the Geats' people,In costly jewels. Modthrytho committed,The great folk-queen, horrible crime:No brave one durst that undertake,Of dear companions, except her liege lord,That on her by day he should look with his eyes:But he wrought for himself death-fetters firm,Twisted by hand: quickly afterwards was,After the hand-grip, the sword appointed,So that the carved weapon must it decide,Tell the death-bale. Such is not queenly customFor a woman to practise, though she be peerless,That a peace-weaver of life should deprive,On account of fierce anger, any dear man.That indeed checked the kinsman of Heming.The drinkers of ale other word said,That she of folk-woes less did inflict,Of hostile deeds, after she first wasGold-adorned given to the young warrior,The brave young noble, after she Offa's hall,O'er the dark flood, by her father's command,Sought in her journey, where she afterwards well,On royal throne, by gifts renowned,Her portion of life whilst living enjoyed,Held her great love for the prince of heroes,Of all mankind, as I have heard say,The very best one by the two seas,Of human race: for that Offa wasBy gifts and war-deeds, the very brave man,Widely renowned; with wisdom he ruledHis own possessions: thence Eomor sprangFor help to heroes, the kinsman of Heming,Grandson of Garmund, crafty in contests.-

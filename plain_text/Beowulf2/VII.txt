VIIHrothgar then spoke, defence of the Scyldings:" For fight of protection, Beowulf my friend,And for assistance, hast thou us sought.Thy father fought a mighty contest;He was of Heatholaf the slayer by handAmong the Wylfings, whem the kin of the Waras'Gainst the terror of war him might not haveAfter that sought he the South-Danes' folkOver the sea-waves, the Honor-Scyldings,When I first ruled the folk of the Danes.And in youth held the jewelled-richHoard-city of heroes, when Heregar was dead,My elder brother bereft of life,The son of Healfdene; he was better than I.Afterwards the feud with money I settled;I sent to the Wylfings o'er the waters' ridgeOld-time treasures; he swore to me oaths.Sorrow is in my mind for me to sayTo any of men what to me Grendel hathOf harm in Heorot with his hateful thoughts,Of sudden woes wrought; my hall-band is,My war-heap, vanished; Weird swept them awayInto Grendel's terror. God easily mayThe mad foe restrain from his evil deeds.Very often they boasted, drunken with beer,Over the ale-cup, the warriors bold,That they in the beer-hall would then awaitGrendel's contest with their terrible swords.Then was this mead-hall in the morning-time,Lordly hall, stained with gore, when day-light shoneAll the bench-rows covered with blood,The hall with sword-gore; I had the less lieges,Dearest companions, whom death took away.Sit now at the feast and free from court-rulesThe heroes victorious, as pleases thy mind."Then was for the Geat-men all togetherIn the beer-hall a bench prepared,Where the bold-minded hastened to sit,Proud in their strength. The thane did his service,Who in his hands bore a gold-adorned ale-cup.Poured out the clear mead. Sometimes sang the minstrelWith clear voice in Heorot: there was joy of heroes,No little band of Danes and Weders.

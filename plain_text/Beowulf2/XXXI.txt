XXXISo the folk-king lived as was rightNot at all had I lost by these rewards,This meed of might, but he gave me treasures,The son of Healfdene, at mine own will,Which I will to thee, warlike king, bring,Willingly offer. Still on thee is allOf favor dependent: I have very fewOf near relations save, Hygelac, thee."He bade then bring in the boar's-head-signThe battle-high helmet, the hoary burnieThe war-sword ornate, his word then uttered:"This cuirass to me Hrothgar then gave,The crafty chief, bade with some wordsThat I of its origin first should thee tell,Said that it had Hiorogar king,Prince of the Scyldings, for a long while:Not to his son sooner would he it give,To the brave Heoroweard, though to him he were dear,The defence of the breast. Use thou it well!"I heard that to the armor four horses too,Exactly alike, in their tracks followed,Yellow as apples: he to him gave possessionOf horses and jewels. So shall a friend do,Not at all cunning snares weave for another,With secret craft death for him prepare,His hand-companion. To Hygelac was,In battle brave, his nephew devoted.And each to the other mindful of kindness.I heard that the necklace he to Hygd gave,The curious treasure which Wealhtheow gave him,The prince's daughter, three horses likewise,Slender and saddle-bright: to her after was,After the ring-giving, the breast adorned.So bravely bore him Ecgtheow's son,The man famed in wars, by his good deeds,He did after right, not at all slew the drunkenHearth-companions: his mind was not cruel,But he of mankind with greatest power,The mighty gift, which God him gave,The warlike one kept. Long he was despised,As him the Geats' children did not reckon good,Nor him at the mead-bench as worthy of muchThe lord of the people would then esteem;They weened very strongly that he was slothful,An unwarlike prince; a change after cameTo the glory-blessed man of each of his sorrows.The earl's defence bade then bring in,The warlike king, Hrethel's bequestAdorned with gold: there was not 'mong the GeatsA better treasure in the shape of a sword:That did he place in Beowulf's keeping,And to him gave seven thousand of gold,A house and dominion. To them both togetherAmong the people was inherited land,A home and its rights, more to the other,A wide-spread kingdom, to him who was better.That happened after in later daysBy battle-contests, when Hygelac died,And to Heardred swords of battleUnder the shields were as a murderer,When him there sought 'mong his victor-peopleThe warriors bold, the Battle-Scylfings,By war oppressed the nephew of Hereric.After to Beowulf the kingdom broadCame into hand: he held it wellFifty winters (then was the king agedThe home-keeper old) until one beganOn the dark nights, a dragon, to rule,Who on the high heath a treasure protected,A steep stony mountain: the path under lay,To men unknown. There within wentSome one of men, who took his desireFrom the heathen hoard: a certain hand-vessel,Adorned with gold, he there then took,Made of red gold, so that was robbedBy the fire sleeping the treasure's guardianBy a thief's craft: the prince after learnt,The innocent warrior, that he was enraged.

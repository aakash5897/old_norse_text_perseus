VIIIHunferth then spoke, the son of Ecglaf,Who at the feet sat of the lord of the Scyldings,Unloosed his war-secret (was the coming of Beowulf,The proud sea-farer, to him mickle grief,For that he granted not that any man elseEver more honor of this mid-earthShould gain under heavens than he himself):"Art thou that Beowulf who strove with BrecaOn the broad sea in swimming-match,When ye two for pride the billows triedAnd for vain boasting in the deep waterRisk√©d your lives? You two no man,Nor friend nor foe, might then dissuadeFrom sorrowful venture, when ye on the sea swam,When ye the sea-waves with your arms covered,Measured the sea-ways, struck with your hands,Glided o'er ocean; with its great billowsWelled up winter's flood. In the power of the watersYe seven nights strove: he in swimming thee conquered,He had greater might. Then him in the morningOn the Heathoremes' land the ocean bore up,Whence he did seek his pleasant home,Dear to his people, the land of the BrondingsHis fair strong city, where he had people,A city and rings. All his boast against theeThe son of Beanstan truly fulfilled.Then ween I for thee a worse result,Though thou in battle wert everywhere good,A fiercer fight, if thou Grendel darestThe space of one night nigh to abide."Beowulf spoke, Ecgtheow's son:" Lo ! thou very much, Hunferth my friend,Drunken with beer, hast spoken of Breca,Hast said of his journey. I say the truth,That I did the more sea-power possess,Endurance 'mid waves, than any man else.We two said this, when we were boys,And we of this boasted (both were then stillIn the prime of youth), that we out on the seaOur lives would risk; and that we accomplished.A naked sword had we, when we swam on the sea,Boldly in hand: ourselves 'gainst the whalesWe thought to defend. Not at all from meOn the flood-waves could he afar float,On the sea quicker; I from him would not.Then we two together were in the seaThe space of five nights, till flood apart drove us,The swelling billows, coldest of storms,Darkening night, and the north windBoisterous and fierce; rough were the waves.The sea-fishes' spirit was then aroused:There 'gainst the foes my body-sark,Hard and hand-locked, to me help afforded;The braided war-burnie on my breast lay,With gold adorned. To the bottom me drewThe hostile foe; he held me fast,Grim in his grip; yet was it granted me,That I the monster with sword-point reached,With battle-brand: the struggle took offThe mighty mere-beast by my own hand.

XLHe bade then the battle-work tell at the hedgeUpon the steep cliff, where the earl-bandThe morning-long day sad in mind sat,The warriors with shields, in expectance of both,The final day and the returnOf the dear man. Little kept silentOf the new tidings he who rode o'er the ness,But he in truth spoke on all sides:" Now is the joy-giver of the folk of the Weders,The lord of the Geats, fast in his death-bed,Fills his grave-rest by the deeds of the worm.Along side of him lies the life-winner tooDead from knife's wounds; with sword might he notUpon the monster in any wayA wound inflict. Wiglaf sits there,Sits over Beowulf Weohstan's son,The earl o'er the other of life deprived,With care attentive, keeps the death-watchOf friend and of foe. Now the people expectA time of strife, after well-knownTo the Franks and the Frisians the fall of the kingBecomes far and wide. The contest was madeStrong 'gainst the Hugs, when Higelac cameWith his ship-army going to the land of the Frisians,Where the Hetwaras felled him in battle,Bravely him conquered with their over-might,So that the mailed-warrior was forced to bow,Fell midst his warriors; no ornaments gaveThe prince to his nobles. To us ever afterThe Merwings' friendship was not to be granted.Nor do I from the Swedes peace or good faithAt all expect; but it was widely knownThat Ongentheow of life deprivedHaethcyn, Hrethel's son, near Ravens' wood,When through their pride at first did seekThe warlike Scylfings the folk of the Geats.Soon to him the ag√©d father of Ohthere,Old and terrible, gave a hand-stroke,Hewed down the sea-chief, rescued his wife,The old man his spouse, robbed of her gold,The mother of Onela and of Ohthere,And then he followed his deadly foesUntil they went in great distressInto Ravens' wood, deprived of their lord.Then besieged he with host those left by the sword,Weary with wounds, woes oft he promisedTo the miserable band the livelong night:Said, he in the morning with the edge of the swordThem would destroy, some on gallows hangFor sport to the fowls. Comfort afterwards cameTo them sad in mind along with daylight,After they Hygelac's horn and trumpets'Sounding perceived, when the brave one cameIn the track going of his peoples' earls.

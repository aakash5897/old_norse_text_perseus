XIThen came from the moor 'neath the misty slopesGrendel going, God's anger he bore.The wicked foe thought of the race of manSome one to entrap in that high hall:He went 'neath the clouds whither he the wine-hall,The gold-hall of men, most thoroughly knew,Shining with gold-plates: that was not the first timeThat he of Hrothgar the home had sought.Ne'er in his life-time before nor afterBolder warriors, hall-thanes, did he find!Then came to the hall the being approaching,Of joys deprived. The door soon sprang openFast in its fire-bands, when he with hands touched it;Then burst the bale-bringer, since he was enraged,The door of the hall. Soon after thatOn the many-colored floor the fiendish one trod,Mad in mind went: from his eyes stoodA loathsome light likest to flame.He saw in the hall many of warriors.A band in peace sleeping all together,A heap of kin-warriors. Then laughed his moodHe thought that he would, ere day came, divide,The terrible monster, of every oneThe life from the body, since to him was fallenA hope of much food. That no longer was fitted.That he might more of the race of manDevour by night. The strong-in-might saw,The kinsman of Hygelac, how the fell foeWith his swift attacks was going to act.That did not the monster think to delay,But quickly he seized for the first timeA sleeping warrior, him tore unresisting,Bit his bone-frame, drank blood from his veins,In great bites him swallowed: soon then he had,Deprived of life, him all devoured,Feet even and hands. Forth nearer he stepped,Seized then with his hands the firm-in-mindWarrior at rest. Him reached out agaistThe fiend with his hand: quickly he seizedThe cunning-in-mind and on his arm sat.Soon this perceived the worker of evil,That he never found in this mid-earth,In the regions of earth, in another manA greater hand-grip: in mood he becameIn his soul frightened; he could not sooner forth.His mind was death-ready; into darkness would flee,The devil-band seek: his course was not there,As he in old-days before had found.Remembered he then, good kinsman of Hygelac,His evening-speech; upright he stoodAnd him fast seized: his fingers crackedThe eoten would outwards: the earl further stepped;The mighty one thought, whereso he might,Afar to escape, and away thenceFlee into the marshes: he knew that his fingersWere in his foe's grip: that was a bad journeyThat the harm-bringing foe had taken to Heorot:The royal hall sounded: for all the Danes was,The city-dwellers, each one of the bold,For earls the ale spilt. Angry were bothFurious contestants: the hall cracked aloud:Then was it great wonder that the wine-hallWithstood the fierce fighters, that it to ground fell not,The fair folk-hall: but it was too fastWithin and without in its iron bandsBy cunning skill forged. There from the sill fellMany a mead-bench, as I have heard say,Adorned with gold, where the foes fought.Of this before weened not wise men of the ScyldingsThat it ever with strength any of men,Goodly and bone-adorned, to pieces might break,With craft destroy, unless flame's embraceIn smoke should it swallow. The sound aroseOften repeated: to the North-Danes stoodFearful terror, to every oneOf those who from the wall the weeping heard,The terrible song sung of th' opposer of God,The joyless song, his pain lamentThe prisoner of hell. He held him too fast,He who of men was strongest in mightIn the day then of this mortal life.

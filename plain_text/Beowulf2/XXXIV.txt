XXXIVHe remembered reward for that people's lossIn later days; to Eadgils he was,To the helpless a friend, with an army supportedO'er the wide sea Ohthere's son,With war-might and weapons: he after avenged himFor the cold care-journeys, of life the king robbed.-So he had survived each one of struggles,Of dangerous contests, Ecgtheow's son,Of mighty deeds, till that very dayThat he 'gainst the serpent was going to fight.He went one of twelve, swollen with rage,The prince of the Geats, the dragon to view;He had then learnt whence rose the feud,Deadly hate to his warriors: into his keeping cameThe great treasure-cup through the hand of the finder.He was in the band the thirteenth man,Who the beginning of this contest caused,Sad in mind, fettered, despised he should thencePoint out the plain: he against his will wentFor that he knew the earth-hall alone,Cave under the earth near the sea-waves,Near the rushing of      waters, which was within fullOf jewels and wire-work: the monstrous guard,The ready warrior, the gold-treasures held,Old under the earth: that was no easy purchaseTo be obtained for any of men.Sat then on the ness the warlike kingWhilst farewell he bade to his hearth-companions,The gold-friend of the Geats: his mind was sad,Restless and death-ready, Weird very nigh,Which should approach the agéd man,Seek the soul's hoard, asunder divideThe life from the body; not then was longThe life of the prince in flesh enclosed.Beowulf spoke, Ecgtheow's son:"Many war-struggles in youth I survived,Times of battle; I remember all that.I was seven winters, when me lord of treasures,Dear ruler of peoples, took from my father;Supported and kept me Hrethel the king,Gave me treasure and feast, remembered our kinship;I was never to him at all a more hatefulMan in his palace than one of his sons,Herebeald and Haethcyn or Hygelac mine.There was for the eldest contrary to rightBy the deeds of his kinsman a death-bed prepared,Since him did Haethcyn from his hornéd bow,His own dear lord, with arrow pierce,Missed he the mark and his kinsman did shoot,One brother the other, with bloody dart:That was fee-less fight, wickedly sinned,Sorrow-bringing to breast; should yet, however,The lord unavenged from life depart.So is it sorrowful to an aged churlTo live to see that his son hangYoung on the gallows: then he utters a moan,A sorrowful song, when his son hangsFor joy to the raven, and he him may not help,Old and experienced, aught for him do.Always is remembered on each one of morningsHis son's departure; he cares not anotherTo hope to see born in his own palace,An heir to his throne, when this one has,Through might of death, suffered such deeds.He sorrowful sees in his son's dwellingThe wine-hall empty, the windy rest-placeOf merriment robbed; the warrior sleeps,The prince in his grave; no sound of harp's there,No sport in the courts, as there were once.

XIVHrothgar then spoke (he went to the hall,Stood by the column, looked at the high roofAdorned with gold and at Grendel's hand):" For this glad sight thanks to the AlmightyQuickly be given! Much evil I suffered,Sorrows from Grendel: God may ever workWonder on wonder, King of glory.Lately it was that I for myselfOf any of woes weened not my life longRelief to obtain, since stained with bloodThe noblest of houses drenched in gore stood;Woe was brought down on every wise man,Of those who weened not that they in their livesThe people's land-work from foes might defend,From demons and devils. Now hath a hero,Through the Lord's might, a deed performed,Which we all before were not at all ableWith wisdom to work. Lo! this may sayEven whatever woman brought forth this sonAfter man's nature, if she yet liveth,That to her the eternal Creator was graciousIn her child-bearing. Now I thee, Beowulf,Noblest of men, for myself as a sonWill love in lite : keep well henceforthThe kinship new. To thee shall no lack beOf earthly wishes o'er which I have power.Very often for less have I fixed the reward,The share of the treasure, to warrior less brave,One worse in the fight. Thou hast for thyselfEffected by deeds that thy fame shall liveFor ever and ever. May thee the AlmightyWith good repay, as He heretofore did !"Beowulf then spoke, Ecgtheow's son:"That deed of might we, with great good-will,That fight have fought, boldly encounteredThe strength of the unknown: I rather would wishThat thou himself now mightest see,The foe in his battle-dress wearied to death.I quickly him with hardest gripsThought then to bind on the death-bed,That he by hand-grip of mine should lieStriving for life, if his body escaped not:I might not him, since the Creator willed not,Cut off from escape: not so firm held I him,The life-destroyer: too powerful was he,The foe in his speed. Yet his hand did he letFor life-protection remain behind,His arm and shoulder: not there, however,Did the helpless man gain any comfort.Not longer shall live the evil-doerBurdened with sins, but him sore painIn his strong grip sternly has seized,In his bonds of bale: there shall abideThe sin-stained man the mickle doom,How the glorious Creator to him will prescribe."Then was more silent the son of EcglafIn his boasting-speech of warlike deeds,After the princes, by the earl's might,Upon the high roof the hand had viewed,The foe-man's fingers, each one before him:Each place of the nails was likest to steel,The heathen's hand-spurs, the battle-monster'sHorrible claw: each one then saidThat him would touch of warlike menNo excellent weapon, so that the demon'sBloody war-hand it would break off.

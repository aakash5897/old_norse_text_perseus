XThen Hrothgar went with his warrior-band,The prince of the Scyldings, out of the hall:The war-prince would Wealhtheow seek,His queen as companion. The glory of kingsGrendel against, as men heard say,A hall-guard had set: he performed special serviceFor the prince of the Danes, he eoten-guard kept.Now the prince of the Geats earnestly trustedIn his proud might, in the Creator's favor.Then he laid him aside his iron burnie,Helmet from head, his jewelled sword gave,Choicest of weapons, to his servant-thane,And bade him keep his armor of war.Then spoke the hero some boastful words,Beowulf the Geat, ere he on bed stied:"I count not myself less good in war-mightFor deeds of battle than Grendel himself:Therefore with my sword I him will not kill,Of life deprive, though I it all may.He knows not these goods, so that he me may slayHew down my shield, although he be fierceIn hostile deeds: but we at night shallFrom swords refrain, if he dare to seekWar without weapons; and then the wise God,The holy Lord, on whatever handMay the glory adjudge, as seems to Him fit."Then lay down the warlike: the pillow receivedThe cheeks of the earl, and him around manyA valiant sea-warrior sought his hall-rest.No one of these thought that thence he shouldAgain his dear home ever seek out,Folk or free-city where he was reared;But they had heard that too many beforeIn this wine-hall bloody death carried offOf the folk of the Danes. But to them the Lord gaveThe web of war-speed, to the folk of the WedersComfort and help, so that they their foesThrough the craft of one all overcame,By the might of one self: the truth is made knownThat the mighty God the race of manHas always ruled. - Came in wan nightThe shadow-goer stepping. The warriors slept,Who the horned hall then were to hold,All except one. That was to men known,That them he might not, whom the Creator would not,The hostile demon drag into darkness;But he keeping watch for his foe in angerAwaited enraged the result of the battle.

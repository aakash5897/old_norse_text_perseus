XXIBeowulf then spoke, Ecgtheow's son:"Sorrow not, wise man! It is better for eachThat his friend he avenge than that he mourn muchEach of us shall the end awaitOf worldly life: let him who may gainHonor ere death. That is for a warrior,When he is dead, afterwards best.Arise, kingdom's guardian! Let us quickly goTo view the track of Grendel's kinsman.I promise it thee: he will not escape,Nor in earth's bosom, nor in mountain-wood,Nor in ocean's depths, go where he will.Throughout this day do thou patience haveOf each of thy woes, as I ween of thee !"Up leaped the ag√©d one, thanked he then God,The mighty Lord, for what the man spoke.Then was for Hrothgar a horse provided,A steed with curled mane: the ruler wiseWell-equipped went; the band stepped forthOf bearers of shields. The foot-tracks wereOn the forest-paths widely perceived,The course o'er the plain: she went straight aheadO'er the murky moor, of knightly thanes boreThe noblest one deprived of life,Of those who with Hrothgar defended his home.Went he then over, the offspring of princes,The steep, stony slopes, the narrow ways,The strait single paths, the unknown course,The headlands steep, many houses of nickers.He one of few went on before,Of the wise men, the plain to view,Until he all at once the mountain-treesO'er the gray stone found bending down,The joyless wood: the water stood underGory and restless. To all the Danes 'twas,To the friends of the Scyldings, bitter in mood,To many a thane sorrow to suffer,To each one of earls, after of AeschereOn the holm-cliff the head they found.The flood boiled with blood (the people looked on),With the hot gore. The horn at times sangThe ready war-song. All the warriors sat down;They saw then in the water many of worm-kind,Strange sea-dragons, seeking the sea,Such nickers lying out on the ness-slopes,As at mid-day often prepareA sorrowful voyage on the sail-road,Worms and wild beasts: rushed they awayFierce and angry; the noise they perceivedThe war-horn sound. The prince of the GeatsWith his arrowed bow deprived one of life,Of strife with the sea, so that stood in his vitalsThe hard war-arrow: he was in the holmThe slower in swimming, whom death took away.Quickly was in the waves with their boar-spears,Their hooked swords, fiercely attacked,Pressed after with struggles and to the ness drawn,The wonderful monster: the men looked uponThe terrible stranger. Beowulf girded himWith noble armor, not for life did he care:The war-burnie should, woven with hands,Wide and well-wrought, seek out the sea,That which his body could well protect,So that him battle-grip might not in breast,The mad one's assault, injure in life:But the bright helmet protected his head,Which was to mingle with the depths of the sea,Adorned with treasure seek the sea-waves,Encircled with diadem, as in days of oldThe weapon-smith wrought it, wondrously framed itSet with swine-bodies, so that it never afterThe flaming war-swords might be able to bite.That was not then the least of strong helps,That to him in need Hrothgar's orator lent:Of that hilted sword Hrunting was name;That was a chief one of old-time treasures;Its edge was of iron, with poison-twigs stained,Hardened with battle-gore; ne'er failed it in fightAny of men, who it wielded with hand,He who durst tread the terrible paths,The folk-place of foes: that was not the first time,That deeds of valor it should perform.The kinsman of Ecglaf remembered not now,Mighty in strength, what he before spokeDrunken with wine, when the weapon he lentTo a better sword-bearer; he himself durst notUnder waves' tumult venture his life,Heroic deeds work; there he lost fame,A name for valor; not so with the other,When he for battle himself had prepared.

XLIIThen was it seen that the way did not prosperTo him who with wrong had hid withinThe hoard 'neath the wall. The keeper ere slewSome one of his foes: then was the feudWith battle avenged. Is it a wonderWhen a warlike earl the end approachesOf his life-fate, when may no longerA man with his kinsmen a mead-hall in-dwell?So was it to Beowulf, when he the mount's keeper,The contest sought: he himself knew notHow his world-severing was to take place;How it against doom's-day deeply had cursedThe mighty princes who that put there,That that man should be guilty of sins,Shut up in cursed places, fast in hell-bonds,Punished with plagues, who should that plain treadHe was not gold-greedy; he rather would haveThe owner's favor sooner looked on.-Wiglaf then spoke, Weohstan's son:"Oft many an earl for the sake of oneSorrow shall suffer, as is happened to us.We might not give to our dear prince,The kingdom's ruler, any advice,So that he might not that gold-keeper meet,Might let him remain where he long was,Dwell in his haunts until the world's end,Fulfil his high fate. The hoard is looked on,Bitterly gotten: that fate was too mightyWhich that folk-king thither enticed.I was therein and looked through it all,The treasures of hall, when 'twas allowed me,Not at all friendly a journey permittedIn 'neath the earth-wall. In haste I tookA great mighty burden with my own handsOf the hoard-treasures, bore them out hitherTo mine own king: he was then still alive,Wise and still conscious: very much spokeThe ag√©d in sorrow and ordered to greet you,Bade that ye should, for your friend's deeds, makeOn the place of the pyre the lofty mound,Mickle and mighty, as he of men wasThe most worthy warrior through the wide earth,While he city-treasures still could enjoy.Let us now hasten a second timeTo see and to seek that heap of treasures,Wonder 'neath wall. I shall direct you,That ye may once more see now enoughOf rings and broad gold. Be the bier ready,Quickly prepared, when we come out,And then let us bear our own dear lord,The man beloved, where he shall longIn the Almighty's keeping patiently wait."Bade he then order, Weohstan's son,The warrior brave, to many of men,Of dwellers in houses, that they the fire-woodShould bear from afar, the lords of the people,To where lay the good one: "Now shall fire eat(The wan flame shall grow) the chief of warriors,Him who oft awaited the iron-shower,When the storm of arrows, loosed from the strings,Leaped over the shield-wall, the shaft did its duty,Fitted with feathers followed the barb."Now then the wise son of WeohstanCalled from the crowd of the kings thanesSeven together, the choicest ones,Went one of eight 'neath the hostile roof;One warrior brave in his hands boreA lighted torch, who went in front.It was not then allotted who should plunder that hoard,After unguarded any portion of itThe warriors saw remain in the hall,Lie wasting away: little one sorrowed,That they hastily carried withoutThe precious treasures. The dragon they shoved,The worm, o'er the wall-cliff, let the waves take,The flood embrace, the keeper of jewels.There was twisted gold on a wain laden,Of each countless heap: the prince was borne,The hoary warrior, to the Whale's ness.

XXVIIIWent then the brave with his trusty bandHimself o'er the sand the sea-beach treading,The wide-stretching shores: the world-candle shone,Sun inclined from the south. They kept on their journey,Went in their might, till the earls' defence,The slayer of Ongentheow within in the city,The good young war-king they then heard sayRings was dividing. To Hygelac wasThe journey of Beowulf quickly made known,That there in the palace the warriors' defence,His shield-companion, living was come,Hale from the battle-play to the court going.Quick was prepared, as the mighty one bade,For the foot-guests the hall within.Sat he then opposite, who 'scaped from the strife,Kinsman with kinsman, after his lordWith courtly speech the loyal one greeted,With mighty words. With mead-cups wentThrough the high hall the daughter of Haereth;The people she served, the ale-cups she boreTo the men at hand. Hygelac beganHis comrade-in-arms in the high hallKindly to ask (wish to know urged him),What were the journeys of the Sea-Geats:"How befell on your way, Beowulf dear,When thou so suddenly thoughtest afarThe strife to seek o'er the salt water,Battle at Heorot?  But didst thou for HrothgarThe widely-known woe in aught remove,For the great chief? I for that in distress,In sorrow-waves pined: the journey I trusted notOf the dear man. Thee long I beggedThat thou the death-spirit by no means wouldst seek,Wouldst let the South-Danes themselves put an end toTheir war against Grendel. I give thanks to God,For that I may see thee now safe and sound."Beowulf spoke, Ecgtheow's son:"That is now plain, Hygelac lord,Our great struggle, to many of men,What a war-time of Grendel and meWas in the place where he very manySorrows had wrought to the Victor-Scyldings,Misery perpetual: all that I avenged,So no kinsman of Grendel need now rejoiceAt the morning-sound over the earth,He who shall live longest of that evil race,By danger surrounded! At first I came thereTo the ringed hall Hrothgar to greet:Soon for me the great son of Healfdene,After he knew of my intention,Near his own son a seat provided.The crowd was in joy; ne'er saw I my life longUnder heaven's vault of sitters-in-hallGreater mead-joy! Sometimes the great queen,Peace-bringer of nations, went through all the hall,Urged the young sons: oft she a braceletGave to a warrior, ere she went to her seat.Sometimes 'fore the court the daughter of HrothgarTo the earls at the end the ale-cup bore,Whom I Freaware the sitters-in-hallHeard call by name, where she buckled treasureGave to the heroes. She had been promised,Young, gold-adorned, to Froda's glad son:Therefore it has happened to the friend of the Scyldings,The kingdom's ruler, and he counts that a gain,That he with the woman a part of fierce feuds,Of quarrels appeased. Often the courtiers,After folk's fall, in a little whileThe deadly spear takes, though good be the bride.It may therefore displease the prince of the Heathobards,And each of the thanes of these peoples,When he with the woman goes into the hall,That a son of the Danes on her should attend:For on him there shines the bequest of the aged,Hard and ring-decked, the Heathobards' treasure,While they with weapons were able to rule,

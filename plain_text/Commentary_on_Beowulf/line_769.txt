ealuscerwen. -scerwen, related to *scerwan 'grant,' 'allot' (bercerwan = 'deprive'). 'Dispensing of ale,' or, in a pregnant sense, of 'bitter or fateful drink' might have come to be used as a figurative expression for 'distress' (Bu. Tid. 292 ff.; Beibl. xxii 372 f.). The interpretation 'staking away of ale,' 'terror' (at the loss of ale) (Heyne4) has found much favor (see Sch√ºcking10), though the form -scerwen (instead of *bescerwen) does not support it. (Spaeth L 3.42.4 describes the term as "reminiscent of the wild oversetting of tankards and spilling of ale when the hall was suddenly attacked.") Of course, the original form as well as meaning may have been obscured. [Cf. Cosijn, Beitr. xxi 19; Krapp's note on Andr. 1526; Grienb., Beitr. xxxvi 84 f.; Siev., ib. 410; Sedgefield's note.]

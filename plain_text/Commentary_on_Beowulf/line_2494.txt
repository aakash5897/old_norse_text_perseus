 The Gif√∞as (Lat. 'Gepidae'), a tribe closely related to the Goths, left their seats near the mouth of the Vistula as early as the third century and settled in the district north of the lower Danube. Their kingdom was destroyed by the Lombards in the latter half of the sixth century. According to this passage, tradition still associated them with their old home.

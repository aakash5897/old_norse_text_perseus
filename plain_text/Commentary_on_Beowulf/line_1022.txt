hiltcumbor. As hilt is normally a st. neut. (occasionally, in the later language, a st. masc. or wk. fem.), a compound hiltecumbor cannot well be admitted. (Siev. xxxvi 420.) The hanner seems to have been fastened to a staff with a sort of handle at its lower end. (Cp. the designation hæftmēce, 1457.) That the very common hilde- should have been misspelt hilte-, it is difficult to believe.

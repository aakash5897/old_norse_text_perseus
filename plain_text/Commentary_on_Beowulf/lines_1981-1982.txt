 By the hook under the [ecedil] in reced the scribe seems to have indicated the open character of the e ([ecedil]=æ); thus in 2126 b[ecedil]l=bǣl, 2652 fæðmi[ecedil]=fæðmiæ. In sa[ecedil]cce 1989 the same sign was added by mistake. (Cf. Intr. xciii.) [Did the scribe of the first part use [ecedil] 1398b? See Varr.]

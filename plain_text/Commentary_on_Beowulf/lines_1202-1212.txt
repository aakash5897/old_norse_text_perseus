þone hring hæfde Higelāc etc. The apparent discrepancy between this statement and a later passage, 2172 ff., where Bēowulf presents to Hygd the necklace bestowed upon him by Wealhþēow, may be explained in two ways. Either Hygd gave the necklace to her husband before he set out on his raid, or the poet entirely forgot his earlier account (1202 ff.), when he came to tell of the presentation to Hygd (2172 ff.). The second alternative is the more probable one, especially if we suppose that at an earlier stage of his work the author had not yet thought at all of queen Hygd; cf. Intr. cviii f. (JEGPh. vi 194.)

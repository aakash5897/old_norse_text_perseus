ātertānum fāh. āter is perhaps used figuratively with regard to the acid employed in the process of (false) damascening. Another possibility is that the serpentine ornamentation (cp. wyrmfāh 1698, also wǣgsweord 1489) was supposed to have a miraculous poisoning effect (Stjerna), the figures of serpents suggesting their wellknown attribute (cp. attorsceaða 2839, also 2523). It is less likely that the edge was really meant to be poisoned. Several ON.passages have been cited as parallels ; thus Brot af Sigurparkv. 20 (interpreted in different ways), Helgakv. Hjǫrv. 9, Helgakv. Hund. i 8. Cf. Bu. Tid. 65 f.; Grienb. 754; Gering's note Stjer. 20 f.; Ebert, R.-L. i 386; Falk L 9.44.3 f. (Cook's note on Chr. 768.) -- āhyrded heaþoswāte. The sword was believed to be hardened by the blood of battle; cp. Njálssaga, ch. 130.13 ; scūrheard, Beow. 1033(?). Or is the reference to some kind of a fluid employed for the hardening (cf. Scheinert [Sievers], Beitr. xxx 378)? In that case, 1460a could be regarded as, practically, a variation of 1459b.

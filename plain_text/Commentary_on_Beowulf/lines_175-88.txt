Hwīlum hīe gehēton æt hærgtrafum etc. A passage remarkable both for the reference to the heathen practice of the Danes and the author's pointed Christian comment. Since Hrōðgār is throughout depicted as a good Christian, the Danes' supplication to a heathen deity (termed gāstbona, 'devil,' cf. Angl. xxxv 137) might conceivably indicate that in time of distress they returned to their former ways --as was done repeatedly in England, see Baeda, H.E. iii, c. 30; iv, c. 27, cp. ii, c. 15. (Routh L 4.138.54 n.; Angl. xxxv 134f., xxxvi 184.) But it is at least equally possible that the author, having in mind the conditions existing among the Danes of the sixth century (on the pagan sanctuary at Hleiðr, see Intr. xxxvii), at this point, failed to live up to his own modernized representation of them. Besides, he seems to have been influenced by reminiscences of the idol worship of the Babylonians described in Daniel, see Intr. cxiii f.-- On sacrifices offered for relief from affliction, see P. Grdr.2 iii 389. The killing of oxen by the Anglo-Saxons 'in sacrificio daemonum' is mentioned in Baeda's H.E. i, c. 30.

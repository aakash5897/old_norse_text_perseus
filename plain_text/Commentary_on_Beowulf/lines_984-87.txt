 The treatment of this passage has not yet reached the stage of finality. Even the commonly accepted form of 984b, foran ǣghwylc wæs (advocated by Sievers, ix 138, R. 232, in place of foran ǣghwylc [with wæs added to the following l.] as printed by Grein, Heyne, et al.), has been assailed on syntactical grounds by Ries (L 6.12.2.378 f.), who suggests, as alternatives, wæs foran ǣghwylc or foran wær ǣghwylc. The retention of the MS. reading steda nægla gehwylc 985a, 'each of the places of the nails' (Schücking, Chambers), carries no conviction. On the other hand, gehwyle may very well be a thoughtless repetition like hilde of 986. Regarding handsporu 986, it seems that spora, elsewhere a wk. masc., has passed over into the fem. class (cf. Siev.  § 278 n. 1). The form egl of the MS. has been taken by many scholars (e.g., Kemble, Grein, Heyne, Sedgefield, Chambers) as a noun, 'spike,' 'talon' (Kemble: 'molestia'), but the only substantiated meanings of egl, egle (the latter being the usual form) are 'awn' ('ail'), 'beard of barley' (B.-T. Suppl.), 'mote' (Luke 6. 41 f.). As to eglu, see T.C.  § 25. [Cf. also Aant. 17; Tr.1 176-8; Arch. cxv 179.]

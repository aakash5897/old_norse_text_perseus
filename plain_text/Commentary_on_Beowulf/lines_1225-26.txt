 In the light of the preceding imper. clause, the general sense of Ic þe an tela/sincgestrēona seems to be: 'I shall rejoice in your prosperity.' (Gummere: " I pray for thee rich possessions.") Others have interpreted the clause as an allusion to the gifts just bestowed on Bēwulf or to future rewards (cp. 1220).

 Although wigge could be regarded as parallel with 1771a, it is a little more natural to take it in an instrumental sense, ' by war' (and, by readiness for war). But the chief emphasis is laid on the peaceful character of Hrōðgār's long reign, just as in the case of Bēowulf, 2732 ff.; cp. also Otfridi 1.75 ff. The remarkable parallel, Ps. 34.3 (Benedict. Office, etc.) : (mē . . .) wīge belūc wrāðum fēndum, Gr.-Wü. iii 331, ='conclude adversus eos qui persequuntur me,' was first noticed by Heyne. Cf ESt. xxxix 464; Angl. xxxv 469; Kock2 114f.

 On the wonderful sword, see note on 1555 f.; on Grendel's pedigree, see note on 106ff. There are a number of doubtful points relating to the curious sword-hilt. 1688 f. on *eth;ǣm wæs ōr writen/fyrngewinnes. This signifies either a graphic illustration (which seems, on the whole, probable) or a runic inscription; both kinds are found together on the famous Franks Casket. As regards ōr . . fyrngewinnes, the allusion may very well be to the ungodly acts of the giants which preceded the deluge (cp. 113 f.), though it would not be impossible to interpret it with reference to Cain's fratricide, the veritable prima causa. Cf. Angl. xxxv 261 f.; Chambers's note. -- 1691. frēcne gefērdon. Admitting the perfective function of gefēran, we should translate 'they suffered terribly' (cf MPh. iii 262); otherwise, 'they behaved daringly' would be a possible variant rendering. -- 1696f. hwām þæt sweord geworht . . . ǣrest wǣre. Evidently the name of the (first) owner (the one who ordered the sword to be made) was written out in runic characters--a practice confirmed by ancient Scand. and Ags. runic inscriptions, cf. Noreen, Altnord. Grammatik i, Appendix, passim; Earle, Ags. Literature, pp. 48 ff.; Earle, The Alfred Jewel (1901) (legend: Aelfred mec heht gewyrcan). That the name of the maker of the sword was meant, is less likely. It is true that examples of such inscriptions are to be readily found (cf. Noreen, l.c.), but the construction of hwām as dat. of agency, 'by whom' (cf Green L 6.8.5.99), would be questionable.

ac hē lust wigeð,/swefeð ond sendeþ. lust wigeð, 'feels joy,' 'enjoys himself' (or, according to Moore, JEGPh. xviii 208, "has his own way"), placed paratactically by the side of the two following verbs. sendan may perhaps be credited with the sense of send to death,' like forsendan 904, forð onsendan 2266 (see Schü. xxxix 103 f.); cp. Lat. 'mittere Orco, umbris,' etc. (e.g. Æneid ix 785, xi 81). Yet the meaning of 'feasting' formerly (orig. by Leo in Heyne1) attributed to it -- on the basis of the noun sand 'dish of food,' 'repast' ('that which is sent to the table') --, though generally given up at present, may be right after all.

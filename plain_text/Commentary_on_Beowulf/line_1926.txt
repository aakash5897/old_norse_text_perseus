hēā healle. The unique plur. of heal is certainly strange, and an emendation like hāh healreced (Holthausen1, cf. Zs. 118) or hēah *healsele may well represent the original reading. If 1926a be considered parallel to 1925b (rather than to 1925a), Kock's conjecture hēah on healle offers an acceptable improvement. (Cp., e.g., the sequence of half-line units, Phoen. 9-10a.)

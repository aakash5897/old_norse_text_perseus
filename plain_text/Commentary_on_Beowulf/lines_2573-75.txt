ðǣr hē þȳ fyrste forman dōgore/wealdan mōste, swā him wyrd ne gescrāf/hrēð æt hilde. We may translate there he had to spend his time (Chambers), (on the first day, i.e.:) for the first time in his life, in such a way that fate did not assign to him glory in battle'; or -- taking wealdan in an absolute sense -- 'there and then (cp. pā ðǣer 331, 1280), for the first time, he had to manage (get along) without victory' (so substantially Mullenhoff xiv 233, Heyne). [MPh. iii 464 interpretation based on the usual meaning of mōt,  'may.']

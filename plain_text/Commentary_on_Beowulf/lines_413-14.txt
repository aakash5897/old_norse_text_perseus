siððan ǣfenlēoht/under heofenes haðor (MS. hador) beholen weorþþeð. The plain meaning is: 'after the sun disappears from the firmament'; heofenes haðor (misspelling d for ð occurs also in 1837, 2869, 2959, 3119), a periphrasis like swegles begong, heofones hwealf, foldan fæþm (see Gloss.). (Generally in OE. poetry the setting sun or stars are said to pass under the earth or the sea.) The reading of hador as hādor ('brightness,' so Ke., Tho., et al.) is not entirely impossible, though hādor is nowhere else found as a noun. -- Other poetical expressions for the coming of night, 649 ff., 1789 f.

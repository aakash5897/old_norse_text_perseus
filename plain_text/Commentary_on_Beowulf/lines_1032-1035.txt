fēla lāf, 'that which is left after the files have done their work.' A notable kenning for 'sword,' see Gloss.: lāf: A form fēl (by the side of fēol, fīl) may well have existed (Bulb.  § 199; see Lang.  § 10.7). But it is equally possible that an earlier MS. had feoia (= fēola), which by a thoughtless scribe was taken for feola 'much' and normalized to fela. This might also account for the plur. meahton. -- With 1032 ff. cp. 1453 f.

 Another allusion to Hygelāc's Frankish expedition. Dæg>hrefn, very likely the slayer of Hygelāc, was killed by Bēowulf, who took from him his sword  (Nægling 2680) (Cf. Rie. Zs. 414; Arch. cxv 181.) It is decidedly interesting to note that Dæghrefn is a Frankish, non-Ags. name; cf. Schioder, Anz. fdA. xii 181, & Die deutschen Personennamen (Festrede, Gottingen, 1907), p. 9. -- It is not quite certain that for dugeðum means ' in the presence of the hosts' duguð may have been used in the abstract sense (cf. Gloss.).

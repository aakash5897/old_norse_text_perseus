bēah. There is no doubt that the mēce (2047) is meant. It would not seem impossible to credit bēah, 'ring,' then 'ornament,' 'precious thing' (bēagas 'things of value,' 80, 523, 2635) with the same development of sense as is seen in the term māðþum, 'treasure,' 'anything precious,' which is applied to a sword (see 1528, 2055). But it is certainly simpler to interpret bēag as 'hilt-ring,' see Stjer. 25, Gloss.: fetelhilt, bindan.

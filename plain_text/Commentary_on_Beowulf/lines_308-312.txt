goldfāh. The lavish use of gold, even on the roof of the hall (see 927, 311; cp. 777, 994), recalls analogous folk-tales, see Panzer 96ff., 257. Scandinavian imagination delighted in such pictures (e.g., Vǫluspá 37, 64; Grímnismál 8, 12, 15; Prose Edda, Gylfaginning 2). The immense gold hoards of Germanic chiefs of the migration period (see note on Eormenrīc, 1197ff.), the precious ornaments found in the Scandinavian countries, and the splendor of Anglo-Saxon court life indicate the historical background of this poetic fancy. Cf. Montelius 164ff.; Chadwick Or. 185 ff.; R.-L. ii 264ff. See Gloss.: gold, and cpds. (Silver is never mentioned in Beowulf.）

Nō hēr cūðlīcor cuman ongunnon . . . Cp. Hel. 558 f.: nio hēr ēr sulīka kumana ni wurðun/ēri fon ōðrun thiodun.-- An alternative interpretation takes cuman as a noun and assigns to onginnan the (recorded) meaning of 'behave,' 'act'; 'visitors never behaved less as strangers.' (Bu. Tid. 290; Angl. xxviii 439; cf. B.-T. Suppl.: angin.) However, the chief emphasis seems to be placed on their entering the country without permission. (Cp. Vǫlsungasaga, ch. 26; Hrólfssaga 36.23 ff.)--246. Probably gearwe is an error for gearo (predicative adj.); 'you were not sure that permission would be readily granted.'-- 247. māga gemēdu. (Cp. māga rīce 1853.) māgas refers to those in authority at the court, see Antiq.  § 2; it could even be understood as a specific allusion to Hrōðgār and Hrōðulf (Intr. xxxi).

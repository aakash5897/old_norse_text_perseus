Summary of songs recited(while the thanes ride slowly), the subjects being Bēowulf, Sigemund, Heremōd. Starting with a lay of praise concerning Bēowulf's exploit, which has just been extolled by the warriors in informal, yet highly eloquent language (856-61), the court poet, well versed in ancient heroic lore, proceeds to recite the adventures of Sigemund, thus raising Bēowulf, as it were, to the rank of pre-eminent Germanic heroes. From indirect discourse the account passes almost imperceptibly to direct statement, and when the Heremōd theme is taken up, we feel like questioning whether Hrōðgār's thane has not been altogether forgotten by the Ags. poet.--We have here a valuable testimony both of the improvisation of lays in connection with great, stirring events and of the circulation of famous short epic poems comparable in scale to The Fight at Finnsburg.

swā nā gȳt dêð. A trivial statement of a matter-of-course fact (cp. 1058). déð refers to ōper gēar, i.e. spring; weder, with its preceding relative clause (1135), is amplifying variation of the implied subject of dêð. The bright spring 'weathers' always observe (hold to) the proper time; cp. 1610 f. [Boer, ZfdA. xlvii 138, Schücking xxxix 106 understand 1134b with reference to 1129 ff.: 'as those people do (or, as is the case with those) who watch for the coming of spring.' Similarly Thorpe, Grem, Arnold, Sedgefield.]

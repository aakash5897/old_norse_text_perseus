 Some edd. have omitted the comma after dyde, construing dyde as 'verbum vicarium' with the object mægen (cp. 1828; Grein Spr.: dōn, 9); but 444b has all the appearance of a complete formula, see 1238b, 1381b, 1676b, 1891b. The literalness of the statement must not be pressed any more than in 1891b.

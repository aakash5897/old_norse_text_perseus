 The enumeration of the different kinds of death (see 1846ff.) recalls classic and ecclesiastic literature, cf. Arch. cxxvi 359 (though some similar Germanic legal formulas might be quoted, see Grimm R.A. 40 ff.). The polysyndetic series suggests the rhetoric of a preacher (such as Wulfstān). The effect is heightened by the repetition of the prefix, forsiteð ond forsworceð 1767 (so forgyteð ond forgȳmeð 1751), cp. 903f.; Dan. 341, 352, El. 208, Chr. 270, Andr. 614, 1364, Gen. (B) 452.

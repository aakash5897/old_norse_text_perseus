 It is not clear whether these feats were performed in the course of a single adventure or on several occasions. In the latter case, the slaying of the niceras could refer to the Breca episode, 549 ff. (cp. 567 ff. (1428 f.) with 423a). By the term niceras (cp. sǣdracan 1426, wyrmas ond wildëor 1430, wundra . . fela 1509; 1510, 558, 549) were understood strange sea-beasts of some kinds; the definite sense of 'walrus,' 'hippopotamus' (Rie. Zs. 388 f., Bu.Zs. 197) need not be looked for in the Beowulf. The fight against giants, five of whom were bound, seems reminiscent of folk-tales. Did Bēowulf bring those five with him as prisoners? (Cf. Panzer 44 ff., 58 ff.) -- 423. The subject of āhsodon is niceras.

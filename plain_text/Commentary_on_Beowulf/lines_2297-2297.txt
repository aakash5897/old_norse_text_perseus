 hlǣw is normally masc. (one instance of the neut.: Sievers, Bezitr. ix 237) and appears as such in all the passages of out poem where the gender can be seen (2803, 2804, 3157, 2412 ?). Hence ealne should not be changed to eal. The metrical difficulty of the MS. reading is removed by the emendation ūtanweard (nom. sing., ref. to the dragon).

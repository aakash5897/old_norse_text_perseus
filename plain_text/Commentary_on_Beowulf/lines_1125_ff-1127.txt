 The Frisian warriors -- presumably men who had been summoned by Finn in preparation for his encounter with the Danes -- return to their homes in the country (hēaburh is a high-sounding epic term that should not be pressed), whilst Hengest stays with Finn in Finnes burb (where the latter is afterwards slain. æt his selfes hām 1147). There is no basis for the inference that Finnes burh (see Finnsb. 36) lies outside of Friesland proper.--Frȳslan . . ., hāmas ond hēaburh is one of the favorite paratactic constructions (Lawrence, Publ. MLAss. xxx 402 n. 17).

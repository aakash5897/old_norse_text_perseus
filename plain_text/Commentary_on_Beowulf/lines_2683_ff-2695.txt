 A sword in Bēowulf's hands was liable to break on account of his excessive strength. A typical feature frequently, met with in old Germanic literature. (E.g., Saxo iv 115 (Offa); Vǫlsungasaga, chs. 15, 35.) Cf. MPh. iii 464f.; also Panzer 35, 41 f, f., 52 f., 281 n. As to Bēowulf's use of swords, see 435 ff., 679 ff., ecc. [Mull. xiv 229; Jellinek & Kraus, ZfdA. xxxv 268 f.]

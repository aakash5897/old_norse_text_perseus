siþðan him Scyppend forscrifen hæfde/in Cāines cynne. This looks strongly theological. Originally, of course, it was Cain who was proscribed and exiled, but, being one of Cain's offspring, Grendel is included in the condemnation. Note the close correspondence of 104ff. and 1260ff. -- 108. þæs þe hē Ābel slōg is explanatory (or variation) of þone cwealm; cp. 2794ff., 1627 f. Cain's fratricide is mentioned again in 1261 ff. (cp. 2741 f., 587 f., 1167 f.). [Cf. Siev. ix 136 f.; Bu. 80; MPh. iii 255, 448. Nearly all edd. begin a fresh sentence with 107a.]

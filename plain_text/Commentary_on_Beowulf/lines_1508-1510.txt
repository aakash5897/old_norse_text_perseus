swā hē ne mihte nō -- hē þǣem mōdig wæs. Metrically, nō might be included either in the first or in the second half-line. But the sense precludes any of the conjectural readings proposed (see Varr.) in connection with mōdig 'courageous.' Adhering to the MS. and assigning to mōdig the meaning of 'angry,' we may translate 'he was angry at them,' i.e., at his enemies, þǣm referring both to the shedemon and, by anticipation, to the wundra fela. The poet had in mind the two causes which prevented Bēowulf from using his arms and wielding his weapons. Precisely this meaning and construction are recorded of Go. mōdags; OS. mōdag, Hel. 1378; for similar meanings, see B.-T.: mōdig, iv; mōdgian, Ex. 459; mōd, Beow. 549; ON. móðugr.

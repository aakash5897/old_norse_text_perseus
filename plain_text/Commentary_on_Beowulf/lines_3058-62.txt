 A recapitulating remark on the end of Bēowulf and of the dragon. The moralizing author denies the dragon the right to the guarding of the hoard: unrihte, 3059. Weard ǣr ofslōh/fēara sumne, i.e., the dragon had slain Bēowulf; fēara sumne, 'one and few others' (cp. 1412), by bold litotes, means 'one' only (Aant. 40). (That the dragon was supposed to have killed others on previous occasions, is very unlikely.) Revenge was inflicted on him by Beowulf (and Wīgläf). [Different interpretations: Bu. 109, 375 ; Heinzel, Anz.fdA. xv 169f., see note on 3051 ff.]

 Scyld's men prepare the funeral of their beloved king, as he bade them while he still 'wielded his words.' (Cf. Siev. xxix 308, Kock2 101. See ll. 2802 ff., 3140.) L. 31, lēof landfruma lange āhte, added paiatactically, conveys the very appropriate idea: 'his had been a long reign.' (Cp. Helgakv. Hund. i 10; for the paratactic clause, cp. OE. Chron. A.D. 871: Ond þæs ofer Eastron gefōr Æþerēd cyning, ond hē rīcsode fīf gēar.) The implied object of āhie (it need not be expressed, see 2208b) is hī, cp. 522, 2732, 911, 2751; folcāgend（e). Practically the same interpretation would result from construing 31a as a variation of 30b (as to the brief clause lange āhte, cp. 1913b). [It would not seem impossible to regard 31 as parallel to 30, i.e. dependent on þenden; in that case the somewhat peculiar lange might be compared to oft, 2867.] Cf. MPh. iii 446.

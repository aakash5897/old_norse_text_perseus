 According to Norse legend, Sigmundr -- an 'Óðmn hero,' like Hermóðr--received a wondrous sword from the great god. See Hyndl. 2 (Par.  § 4), Vǫlsungasaga, ch. 3 (a detailed account of Sigmund's obtaining the sword). -- The dragon is, as it were, nailed on the wall. -- Note the end rime of 890b: 891b.

 Taking ǣht (= ēht, Lang.  § 9.3) as an analogical formation in place of the normal ōht, and construing segn as the subject of oferēodon, we obtain very satisfactory sense by the slight alteration Higelāce[s]. For other interpretations, see Varr.; also Schroer, Angl. xiii 346 ff.; Aant. 38, Schücking's and Sedgefield's notes; Green L 6.8.5. 101, & L 5.55 (: "then was (the) treasure offered (yielded) by the folk of the Swedes, their banner to H.").

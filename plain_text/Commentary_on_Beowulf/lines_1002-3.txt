Nō þæt ȳðe byð/tō beflēōnne. The import of the vague þæt is fully cleared up by the context: it is impossible to escape death (fate). A proverbial saying well known in ON. literature ; e.g., Saxo viii 295: 'fatis arduum obstare.' Cp. Iliad vi 488: μοῖραν δ᾽ οὔτινά φημι πεφυγμένον ἔμμεναι ἀνδρῶν. (Arch. cxv 179 n.)

 The hall is supposed to have been named Heor(o)t from horns (antlers) fastened to the gables, although the appellation horn= 'gable' (horn-gēap 82, -reced 704, hornas, Finnsb. 4, horn-sæl, -sele in other poems) seems to be derived merely from 'horn-shaped projections on the gable-ends' (B.-T., cf. Miller, Angl. xii 396 f.). But the name may have been primarily symbolical, the hart signifying royalty (A. Bugge, ZfdPh. xli 375 n.). On the Danish royal hall, see Intr. xxxvii.

The Song of Creation bears no special resemblance to Cædmon's famous Hymn, but follows pretty closely upon the lines suggested by the biblical account. Cp. 94f. and Gen. i 16f., 97b-98 and Gen. i 21, 24, 26, 28. For some slight similarities to Ex. 24ff., see MLN. xxxiii 221. The theme is often touched upon in Ags. poetry. See Angl. xxxv 113 ff. [Also Vergil has a court minstrel recite the creation of the world, Æn. i 742 ff.] -- The rare note of joy in the beauty of nature contrasts impressively with the melancholy inspired by the dreary, somber abode of Grendel. (God's bright sun: 570, cp. 606, 1571f., 1801ff., 1965, 2072.)

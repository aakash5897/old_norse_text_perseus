of ðām lēoma stōd etc. We are reminded of the light in the Grendel cave, 1516f., 1570ff.2773 f. Ðā ic on hlǣwe gefrægn hord rēafian,/eald enta geweorc ānne mannan. Following after a passage of description and reflection, a new and important event is introduced by means of the gefrægnformula (cp. 2694, 2752). The fact that the 'man' is well known is ignored. See note on 100b (ān). By enta geweorc either the hoard itself or the stone chamber is meant (cp. 2212 f.).

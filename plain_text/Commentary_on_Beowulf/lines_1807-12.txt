Heht þā se hearda Hrunting beran etc. 'Then the brave son of Ecglāf had Hrunting brought (cp. 1023 f.), bade [him] take his sword, the precious weapon; he [i.e., Bēowulf] thanked him for that gift (see Gloss.: lēan), said he considered the war-friend [cp. hbldefrōfor, Wald. ii 12] good, etc.' It should be noted that the subject of cwæð 1810 must be the same as that of sægde 1809 (cf. Intr. lvi), and that the abrupt change of subject (from Unferð to Bēowulf) in 1809 is not unparalleled (cf. Intr. lxviii). The fact that Hrunting had been restored to Unferð has been passed over as irrelevant; but the presentation of a parting gift (cp. 1866 ff.) to the hero is appropriately dwelt upon with some emphasis.

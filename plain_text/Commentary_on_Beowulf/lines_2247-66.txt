 This characteristic, impressive elegy (see Intr. liv f, note on 2105 ff.) may be compared with the recital of the bereaved father's sorrow, 2444ff., which is also virtually a sample of elegiac verse but nearer its prototype, viz. the lament for the dead or funeral dirge (see 1117 f., 3152ff., 3171 ff.). Cf. L 4.126 (Sch√ºcking, Sieper).

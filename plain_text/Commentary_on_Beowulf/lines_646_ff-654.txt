 The emendation adopted by all recent edd.: siððan hīe sunnan lēoht gesēon [ne] meahton has a false ring; one would expect, at least, something like leng gesēon ne meahton. (Cf. also Schuchardt L 6.14.2.25.) Ll. 648 ff. plainly mean: 'from the time that they could see the light of the sun, until (oþ ðe) night came'; exactly as Brun. 13 ff. (siððan . . . oð . . .). Thus, the meaning (of oþ ðe, or oþðe) 'until' (so some earlier edd., like Grein, Arnold, cf. Heyne1-3) need not be given up for Bugge's opðe= 'and' (i.e., a variant of the regular 'or,' see Bu. Tid. 57, cf. E. tr.). Nor do we need to assume a lacuna (Grein, cf. Gru.). In other words, the king knew that fight had been in Grendel's mind all day long; Grendel had been waiting from morning till night to renew his attacks in the hall, just as the dragon -- hordweard onbād/earfoðlice, oð ðæt ǣfen cwōm 2302 f. -- Close parallels to the use of tō (þǣm hēahsele) are found in 1990, 1207. Whether we consider āhlæcan as 'dat. used as instr.' (Sedgefield), as 'dat. of personal agency' (Green L 6.8.5.98: "a fight was contemplated by the monster"), or a variety of the dat. of interest (cp. Lat. 'mihi consilium captum est,' see also Heusler, Altisl. Elementarbuch  § 383), is immaterial to the general interpretation of the context. [Cf. also Bu. 89; ten Brink 52; Tr.1 160.]

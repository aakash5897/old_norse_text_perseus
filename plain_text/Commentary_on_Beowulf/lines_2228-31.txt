 A hypothetical restoration of the missing words might be attempted as follows.						hwæðre (earm)sceapen  (atolan wyrmewræcmon ætwand  --him wæs wrōht) sceapen--(fūs on fēðe,  þā hyne) se fǣr begeat.Sincfaet (firde).With 2229b cp. 2287, 2913 ; with 2230a cp. 970. As to firde, see 156: feorran; also hæfde, or funde (proposed by Chambers) would be acceptable. -- For 2227 the reading þæt (him from) ðām gyst（e gryre)-brōga stōd would seem natural (so, except for the omission of him, Grein1). Cp. 2564., 783f. as to the meaning of gyst, see gryregrest 2560.

Mōd þrȳðe [ne] wæg etc. The serious difficulties of meaning and form (nom. þrȳðo [MS.] instead of þrȳð, cf. Hart, MLN. xviii 117f.; but also Angl. xxviii 452) are removed by Schücking's emendation. (See Varr.) The abrupt transition to þrȳð resembles the sudden appearance of Heremōd 901, who, like her, serves as a (partial) antithesis.

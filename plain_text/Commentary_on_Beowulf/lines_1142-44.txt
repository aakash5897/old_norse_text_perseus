 A passage that has received most divergent comments. him. . . .on bearm dyde, which has been sometimes rendered by 'plunged into his bosom' (killing him) (so Kemble, Ettmüller, Grein, cf. Heinzel, Anz.fdA. x 227), very likely means 'placed on his lap,' i.e., gave to him as a present; cp. 2194, 2404 also Gnom. Cott. 25: sweord sceal on bearme.--The reading Hūn (nom.) Lāfing (acc., name of sword) is less acceptable than Hūnlāfing, meaning 'son of Hūnlāf,' i.e. quite possibly, nephew of Gūðlāf and Ōslāf, see Introd. to The Fight at Finnsburg. -- The conjectural worodrǣdenne (an unknown word; according to Bugge's interpretation: 'he did not refuse retainership,' i.e. he agreed to become Finn's liegeman [by accepting from Hūn, one of Finn's followers, the sword Lāfing]) has been very generally rejected. woroldrǣden has been variously explained as law, way, rule, or custom, of the world, implying such diverse ideas as 'death,' 'fate,' 'revenge,' 'duty,' 'sanctity of oath.' (E.g., Huchon: "aussi lui ne recula-t-il pas devant la destinée"; Cl. Hall: "he did not run counter to the way of the world," i.e. 'he fell into temptation'; Ayres: "he did not thus prove recreant to his duty"; Schücking: "without running counter to the law of the world," i.e. 'without violating his oaths.') More to the point seems the sense 'condition,' 'stipulation,' the rather redundant worold- referring vaguely to something which is in accordance with the ordinary course of life (cp., e.g., woruldmāgas, Gen. 2178). As to forwyrnan, it is regularly used with the dat. of the person (expressed or, as in this case, implied) and the gen. of the thing asked for or insisted upon [or a þæt-clause]. Accordingly the following rendering is considered plausible: 'Under these circumstances (or, in this frame of mind) he did not refuse [him, i.e. Hūnlāfing] the condition, when Hūnlāfing placed the battle-flame (or: Battle-Flame), the best of swords, on his lap.' In other words, Hengest is presented with a famous sword (which has wrought havoc in the fight against the Frisians, 1145) with the stipulation [we now supply by conjecture:] that the vengeance he is brooding over is to be carried into execution. Hengest accepts and keeps his word. (Cf. JEGPh. xiv 547.) [Cf. Rie. Zs. 396 ff.; Heinzel, Anz.fdA. x 226 f.; Bu. 32 ff.; Aant. 20 f.; Shipley L 6.8.4.32; Tr. F. 25 f., Bonn.

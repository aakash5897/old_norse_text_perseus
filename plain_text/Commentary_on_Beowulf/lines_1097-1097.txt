unflitme is unexplained. It may be connected with flītan 'contend,' cp. unbefliten 'uncontested'; elne unflitme: 'with undisputed zeal.' It has been held that the instr. elne has the force of an intensive adverb, 'much,' 'very' (and that unflitme is an adv. form), which is but adding another guess. Kock2 109 proposes elne, unflitme: "strongly and indisputably." No light is obtained from the equally obscure unhlitme 1129. [Grienb. 748 would translate 'firmly' or 'inviolably,' deriving unflitme from flēotan 'float.']

in campe (MS. cempan). As cempa has nowhere the function of a collective noun (cf. Gloss.: on), and in (on) is never found in the sense of ' among' with a plural denoting ' men,' cempan is unacceptable both as dat. sing. and dat. plur. Cf. Siev. xxxvi 409 f. The scribe evidently had in mind cempan of 2502.

The introduction of Grendel. The thought of this passage, though proceeding by a circuitous route, is not obscure. An evil spirit is angered by the rejoicing in Heorot (86-90a). One of the songs recited in the hall is mentioned (90b-98). After looking back for a moment the poet returns to the demon, Grendel, who is now spoken of as dwelling in the moors (100b-104a). This leads the author to relate how Grendel came to live there, viz. by being descended from Cain, whom God had exiled for the murder of Abel (104b-114). (Whereupon Grendel's first attack on Heorot is narrated.)

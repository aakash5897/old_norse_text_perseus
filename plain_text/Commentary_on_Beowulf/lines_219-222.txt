ymb āntīd, 'after the lapse of a normal space of time'; ōþres dōgores, 'on the following day.' Cf.Siev. xxix 326 f., Gloss.: āntid. It seems possible, however, to construe ōþres dōgores as depending on āntīd; the voyage takes one day and a reasonable space of time (as much as is to be expected) of another day. [Leonard, L 3.44, returning to Grein's suggestion 'āntīd = hora prima,' translates "after the risen sun Of the next day"; cf. 569 ff.] Whether the distance from Bēowulf's home to the coast near Hleiðr (see Intr. xxxvii, xlviii) could really have been covered in so short a time, is to be doubted. (In the brief account of the return voyage, 1903 ff., no mention is made of the passing of a day.) The measuring of distance by the days required for the voyage (ON. dógr, i.e. 12 hours) was customary among the Scandinavians (see Falk, p. 17; Ōhthere's voyage in Ælfred's Orosius [ed. Sweet] 17.9 ff. and passim). -- The different days are clearly marked off in the first main part: 3rd day, l. 837; 4th day, l. 1311 (nōn 1600); 5th day, l. 1802; (arrival on the 6th day? l. 1912, sigel sūðan fūs 1966).

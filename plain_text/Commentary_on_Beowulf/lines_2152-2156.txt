eafor hēafodsegn. The reading eafor hēafodsegn (asyndetic parataxis, see note on 398) is preferable to eafbrhēafodsegn, which would be a very exceptional double compound (cf. Rie. Zs. 405). The words undoubtedly denote a banner, the first of the four gifts which are enumerated here in the same order as in 1020 ff. The boar banner (a banner with a boar-figure on it) may be compared to the Scand. raven banners (see OE. Chron. A.D. 878 (B, C, D, E): se gūðafana . . . þē hīe Hræfn hēton; cf Hartung L 9.50.450). Was it called a 'head sign' because it was borne aloft in front of the king? (See Baeda, H.E. ii, c. 16; Beow. 47 f., El. 76 [?].) Or does the compound mean 'great banner' ? Or, perhaps, an emblem (boar) such as was attached to the helmet which covered the head ? (Cf. Siev. xxxvi 417 f.)

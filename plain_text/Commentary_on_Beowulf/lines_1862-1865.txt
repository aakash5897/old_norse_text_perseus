 The risky, if tempting interpretation of heaþu, or hēaþu (from hēah) as 'sea' (also in heaþolīðende, see Gloss.) has been generally abandoned in favor of the emendation heafu, which is sustained by the occurrence of ofer heafo in 2477. Sarrazin's rendering of ofer heaþu by ' after the war' (Sarr. St. 27) is by no means impossible, though otherwise heaþu 'war' is known only as the first element of compounds. (Cp. the very rare use of the noun heoru by the side of numerous compounds. )

hāt in gān/sēon sibbegedriht samod ætgædere. sibbegedriht probably refers to Bēowulf and his men, as in 729; the object of sëon is understood, viz. mē, see 396. (MPh. iii 253.) In case the company of Danes were meant by sibbegedriht, the object of hāt would have to be supplied: 'command them to go in.'

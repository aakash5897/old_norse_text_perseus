wæs þæt blōd tō þæs hāt,/ættren ellorgǣst. Probably ættren ellorgǣst is parallel with blōd (logical adjunct and headword forming the terms of variation), though ættren could be (and usually is) construed as predicative adj., parallel with hāt (cp. 49 f., 2209 f ). Cf. MPh. iii 239. The reference is to Grendel, just as in 1614 Grendel's head is meant.

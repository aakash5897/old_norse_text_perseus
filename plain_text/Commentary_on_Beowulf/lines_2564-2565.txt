ecgum unglāw (MS.). In view of the doubtful status of the intensive prefix un- (see note on 357), an- has been substituted for it; anglāw 'very sharp' is certainly more satisfactory than B.-T.'s unglēaw 'dull.' The physical sense of 'sharp,' though nowhere else recorded, may not unreasonably be attributed to glēaw, of which glāw  is a variant form, see Lang.  § 15 n. [Cf. also Gr. Spr.; Angl. xxix 380, ESt. xxxix 466.]

 We are told here that Grendel made an attack on two successive nights (as the troll does on two successive Yule-eves, before the final defeat, in the Grettissaga [Intr. xiv] and the Hrólfssaga [Par.  § 9], cp. analogous folk-tales, Panzer 96 ff., 266). But in fact, he wrought destruction 'much oftener' (1579), see 147 ff., 473 ff., 646 ff.--On māre 136, 'additional,' see MPh. iii 450.

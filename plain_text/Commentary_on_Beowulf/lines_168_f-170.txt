nō hē þone gifstōl etc. A side remark of similar import to 711: Godes yrre bær. 'He was not allowed to approach the throne (of God, cp. Chr. 572), the sacred one (lit.: the precious thing), [appearing] in the presence of the Lord, nor did he (God) take thought of him' (cf. Angl. xxxv 254). The curse resting on Grendel is complete. witan is to be understood in the well-established sense of 'be conscious of,' 'feel,' 'show'; cp. Wand. 27: [min] mine wisse. See JEGPh. viii 254 f. --It is obvious that these two lines could have been easily interpolated; see Intr. cxvi. --The difficulties experienced in the interpretation of this passage arise chiefly from (1) the ambiguity of gifstōl, which could denote either God's or Hrōðgār's throne, (2) the possibility of rendering grētan either by 'approach' or 'attack,' (3) the uncertainty as to the real force of myne. (The possibility of identifying hē with the king is too remote to be seriously considered.) In case gifstōl is understood as Hrōðgār's throne, the lines might be thought to mean that Grendel was not allowed, because he was 'prevented by the Lord,' to approach the royal throne; i.e., though making his home in the hall at night, he was unlike a dutiful retainer, who receives gifts from his lord. See espec. Kock 225 f. & L 5.44.4.7 f. (māþðum ref. to the precious gifts dispensed by the king; myne 'gratitude.')

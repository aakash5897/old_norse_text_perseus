 The statement is not quite clear logically. It involves the anticipation of the result of the action: sīo hand gebarn 2697b, and a loose use of þæt 2699a (see Gloss.). The meaning is this: ' he did not care for(i.e. aim at) the head [of the dragon], but his hand was burned in striking the monster a little lower down, etc.' Dragons are vulnerable in their lower parts; see especially Par.  § 7: Saxo ii 38 f. (Frotho's dragon fight). Cf. Bu. 105. [Aant. 37: ' he did not care for his (own) head, i.e. life.']

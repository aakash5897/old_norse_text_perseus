Hūru þæt on lande lȳt manna ðāh. We have the choice between (1) taking lȳt as dat. with impers. ðēon, ' that has prospered with few men' (the accus. would be exceedingly questionable) and (2) construing lȳt as the subject, assigning to the verb the sense of 'attain,' 'achieve' (cf. MPh. iii 465). In the latter case, it is true, geðēon would be expected.

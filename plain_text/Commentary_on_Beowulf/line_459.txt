Geslōh þīn fæder fǣhðe mǣste. geslēan is understood in the perfective (resultative) sense: 'thy father brought about by fight the greatest feud' (or, 'of feuds,' since fǣhðe perhaps stands for fǣhða, cp. Chr. 617, Beosw. 78, 193, 1119, 2328, etc.). See Müllenhoff, Anz. fd A. iii 179, MLN. xvi 15, MPh. iii 262. The feud was probably considered memorable on account of the persons or circumstances connected with it. -- The chief alternative renderings advocated are: 'fought the greatest fight' (see Kock 226 f), and 'fought out the greatest feud' (see Lorz 64; Chambers). The former, while not entirely impossible (cp. 1083), ignores the customary perfective function of geslēan. The latter is unconvincing, since the slaying of Heaþolāf by no means finishes the feud. Moreover, Hiōðgār is not interested primarily in relating a great exploit of Ecgþēow's, but means to emphasize the friendly relations existing between the Danes and Geats, his main point being the subsequent settlement of that feud (þā [demonstr.] fǣbðe 470).

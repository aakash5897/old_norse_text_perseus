 Nearly all edd. place a period after gebunden, taking 870b-71a as the close of the sentence, "framed a new story, founded upon fact" (Cl. Hall). But it is much to be doubted whether word would have been used to convey such a meaning. (Fat. Ap. 1: ic pysne sang sīðgeōmor fand.) The parenthetical clause, according to the punctuation introduced by Rieger (Rie. L., see Zs. 390) and approved by Bugge (Bu. Zs. 203), 'one word found another rightly bound,' contains an apt description of the alliterative verse form. (See also Earle's note ) The eft of 871 ('in his turn') goes with hwīlum 867, and both correspond with hwīlum 864 (cp. 2107 ff.); secg takes up the subject of the sentence, cyninges ðegn. (Cf. MPh. iii 456.) -- The type of the combination word ōþer (similarly 652, 2484, 2908, 2985) is a substitute for the repetition of the noun ('grammatical rime'), see note on 440a. (Kluge, Beitr. ix 427.) Cp. Gnom. Cott. 52: fyrd wið fyrde, fēond wið ōðrum.

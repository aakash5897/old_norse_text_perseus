 Of the numerous occasions on which the animals of prey are introduced (in Gen., Ex., Brun., Mald., El., Jud., Finnsb.), this is the only one where raven and eagle hold a conversation. The bold and brilliant picture reminds us not only of 'The Twa Corbies' ('The Three Ravens'), but of ON. literature (e.g. Brot af Sigur√æarkv. 13, Helgakv. Hund. i 5a); cf. Sarrazin, ESt. xxiii 255; MLN. xvi 18.

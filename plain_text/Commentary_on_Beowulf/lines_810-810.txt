mōdes myrðe, in accordance with Holthausen's explanation of myrð（u) as 'trouble,' 'affliction' (cp. OHG. merrida), is stylistically preferable to mōdes myr（h）ðe, 'joy of heart,' whether myr（h）ðe be taken as dat. or as gen. (parallel with fyrene; Cl. Hall, Lawrence, MLN. xxv 156: "had accomplished much of the joy of his heart"). Cp. mōdes brecða 171; 164 ff., 474 ff., 591 ff., 2003 ff.

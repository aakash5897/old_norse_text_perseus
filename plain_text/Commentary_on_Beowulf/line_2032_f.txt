 As ofþyncan is regularly construed with the dative, the retention of ðēoden appears, after all, quite hazardous, although the joining of different cases (ðēoden, gehwäm) in itself would not count as an obstacle (MPh. iii 259). [It has been suggested that ðēoden may stand for ðēodn（e) with final e elided, cf. Rie.Zs 404; note on 698a.]

Ād (MS. að) wæs geæfned, ond icge gold/āhæfen of horde. Why is gold fetched from the hoard? Presumably the reference is to precious objects to be placed on the funeral pile -- cp. 1111 f., 3138 ff., perhaps 3134 f. 3163 ff.; 36 ff.; Par.  § 7: Saxo viii 264 --, which points to ād as the proper reading; see also 1110: Æt ðǣm āde. (If āð were meant, we should expect the plural, cp. 1097.) [Lawrence, Publ. MLAss. xxx 406 suggests that Finn intended to rewald his warriors with presents of gold. -- The payment of wergild seems out of the question.] -- icge is entirely obscure; see Varr., B.-T. One of many possibilities is to explain it as a corruption of the adj. æce found once in the runic inscription of the Isle of Wight sword, which perhaps means 'one's own' (Hempl, Publ. MLAss. xviii 95 ff.); ǣce gold = 'aurum domesticum'; JEGPh. viii 256.

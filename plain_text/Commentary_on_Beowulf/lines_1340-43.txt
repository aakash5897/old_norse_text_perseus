feor, i.e. (going) far (in accomplishing her purpose). The phrase fǣhðe stǣlan (cp. Gen. 1351 f.), in all probability, denotes 'avenge hostility,' 'retaliate' (in the prosecution of a feud), cf. Kock 229 ff. There appears to be no warrant for the meaning 'institute,' 'carry on' attributed to stǣlan (thus, e.g., Aant. 23). hreþerbealo hearde could be regarded as acc., parallel with faaeligmacr;hðe, but this would result in a rather unnatural breaking up of the context (1340-44). Also the construction of grēoteþ with hreþerbealo hearde as object would be awkward and questionable. We may venture to take the combination as a loosely connected, semi-exclamatory noun phrase, cp. 936, 2035. -- 1342. æfter sincgyfan. Æschere, who occupied an exalted position, receives a title fit for a king.

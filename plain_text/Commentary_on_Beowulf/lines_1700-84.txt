 The much discussed harangue of Hrōðgār, which shows the moralizing, didactic turn of the poem at its very height, falls into four well-marked divisions, viz. a. 1700-9a; b. 1709b-24a (the second Heremōd digression, see 901-15); c. 1724b-68 (the 'sermon' proper); d. 1769-84. It is conspicuous for the blending of heroic and theological motives. There can be no doubt that this address of the king's forms an organic element in the structural plan of the epic, corresponding in its function to Hrōðgār's speech after the first combat together with the first Heremōd episode; cf. Intr. lii. Moreover, it is entirely in harmony with the high moral tone, the serious outlook, and spiritual refinement of the poem. Of course, its excessive length and strong homiletic flavor have laid the third division, and even other parts, open to the charge of having been interpolated by a man versed and interested in theology (Müllenhoff's Interpolator B), and it is, indeed, possible that the ' sermon' represents a later addition to the text. In that case, the insertion would have necessitated also some changes in the following (and perhaps, the preceding) division. See especially Müllenhoff 130f.; Earle, pp. lxxxviii, 166f.; Angl. xxxv 474ff., xxxvi 183 f.; Intr. cxiv ff.

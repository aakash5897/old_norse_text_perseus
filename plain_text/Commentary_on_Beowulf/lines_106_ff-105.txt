Grendel's descent from Cain. The conception of the descent of monsters (evil spirits) and giants from Cain (cp. also 1261 ff.), and of the destruction of the giants by the deluge (so also 1688 ff.) is based ultimately on the biblical narrative, a causal relation being established between Gen. iv, vi 2, 4 (gigantes) and vi 5-7, vii. The direct source has not been discovered in this case, though Hebrew tradition (like that contained in the apocalyptic Book of Enoch) and Christian interpretation of Scripture have been adduced. See Emerson L 4.149. 865 ff., 878 ff.; Angl. xxxv 259 ff.; also notes on 1555 f., 1688 ff. On Grendel, see Intr. l.

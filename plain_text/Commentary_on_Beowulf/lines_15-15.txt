þ (= þæt) seems to have been introduced for þē or þā by the late scribe. On þæt standing for the relat. pron. with a sing. masc. or fem. or a plur. antecedent, see Kock L 6.13. 1.30f.; on a few cases of þ used for þā, see Zupitza's note; also l. 3134 (?). Cf. J. M. Hart, MLN. i, col. 175-7; Napier, Philol. Soc. Transact., 1907-10, p. 188 (þ used as contraction for þē); F. Wende, Uber die nacbgestellten Prapositionen im Ags. (Palaestra lxx, 1915), p. 37 (interchange of þē and þæt). See also 649 (oþ ðe = oþ þæt) and note on 1141. [Cha. would retain þæt (conj.) and take lange hwīle as the object of drugon, 'a long time of sorrow' (?); Kock2 100 takes drugon intransitively, 'they lived without a lord.']

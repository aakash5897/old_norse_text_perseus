 The disloyalty of the ten cowardly followers of Bēowulf, who flee for then lives, is not unlike the defection of the disciples of Christ, see Malk xiv 50, Mat. xxvi 56. (Also the injunction to the companions, 2529 may recall Mark xiv 34, Mat. xxvi 38.) Likewise, Wïglāf's heroic assistance is matched by the ἀριστεία of Peter (Mat. xxvi 51, John xviii 10) so nobly glorified in the Heliand (4867 ff.).

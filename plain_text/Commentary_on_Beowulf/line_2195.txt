seofan þūsendo. þūsend is sometimes used 'of value without expressing the unit' (B.-T.). In this case, as also, e.g , repeatedly in Bede, the hīd ('familia') is evidently understood (see Leo L 4. 24.101. n. 2; Ettmuller, Transl.; Kluge ix 191 f.; Plummer's Saxon Chronicles ii, p. 23; Angl. xxvii 411 f), so that the size of the land given to Bēowulf would equal that of North Mercia; cp. OE Bede 240.2: Norðmercum, þāra londes is seofon þūsendo (= iii, c. 24: 'familiarum VII milium'). See note on 2994f.

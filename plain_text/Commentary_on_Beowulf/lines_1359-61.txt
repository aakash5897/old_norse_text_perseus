ðǣr fyrgenstrēam/under næssa genipu niþer gewīteð,/flōd under foldan. Lawrence, l.c. 212, thinks that fyrgenstrēam signifies a waterfall, and that næssa genipu may be "the fine spray thrown out by the fall in its descent, and blown about over the windy nesses." But næssa genipu might as well denote the cliffs with the overhanging trees darkening the water,and foldan, which is naturally to be regarded as parallel with it, might also refer to the rocky ground, or cliffs. See Gloss.: under, i 2. (Cf. Lawrence 213.)

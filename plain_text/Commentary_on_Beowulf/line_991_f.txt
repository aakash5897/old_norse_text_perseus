Ðā wæs hāten . . Heort . . . gefrætwod. The inf. wesan is to be understood in connection with gefrætwod. cf. Aant. 18. The construction of the passive of hātan with a passive inf. looks like a Latinism, see Arch. cxxvi 355. [Chambers places a comma after hreþe. He is followed by J. F. Royster, who cites the sentence as an example of 'mixed construction,' -- the idea of the 'ordering' or 'causing' giving way to that of the 'completion' of action, see JEGPh. xvii 89 n. 28.] -- 992b. fela pǣra wæs. Type D4.

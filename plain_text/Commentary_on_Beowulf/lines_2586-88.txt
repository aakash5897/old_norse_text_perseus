 It is possible that grundwong refers to the dragon's cave (see 2770) or the ground in front of it (cf. Bu.Tid. 298). But it seems on the whole more natural that it should denote the same as eormengrund, ginne grund, i.e., earth in general (as explained by earlier scholars), or that the phrase ' give up that region,' in this context, implies 'leaving the earth' (Aant. 36). These lines and the following ones express nearly the same idea, the former negatively, the latter positively. Considering further the contrast between wolde 2588 and sceolde [ofer] willan 2589, we may venture to translate literally: 'that was not a pleasant (willing) journey (or, couse of action) [i.e.] that the illustrious son of Ecgðēo was willing to leave the earth.' (ESt. xxxix 466, MLN. xxiv 94f.)

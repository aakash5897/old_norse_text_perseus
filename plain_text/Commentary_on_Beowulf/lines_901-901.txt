siððan Heremōdes-hild sweoðrode. For the punctuation, see MPh. iii 457. Sigemund's glory survived that of Heremōd (who in Hyndlulyjóð is mentioned before Sigmund). It was unrivaled after Heremōd's decline, -- sweðrode refers either to his advancing years or (probably) to his lamentable death. (Cp. Grettissaga, ch. 58: 'Grettir was the strongest man ever known in the land, since Ormr Stórólfsson and pórálfr Skólmsson left off their trials of strength.' Similarly two heroes, Offa and Alewih, are set against one another in Wids. 35 ff., see the quotation in note on 1931-62.)A gratuitous transposition of ll. 901-915 (861, 901-915, 862-900, 916 ff.) was proposed by Joseph (L 5.22). (Cf. ten Brink 60.)

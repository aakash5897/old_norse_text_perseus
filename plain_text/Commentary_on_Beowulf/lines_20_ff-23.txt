Swā, 'in such a way [as he (Bēowulf or, more likely, Scyld) did].' The missing reference to Scyld's liberality is virtually implied in the previous statements concerning him. For how could the king have been so successful in war, had he not been conspicuous for generosity, which gained for him the loyalty of his followers? These two ideas were inseparably connected in the minds of the ancient Teutons. Saxo says in his praise of Scioldus' liberality (i 12): 'Proceres non solum domesticis (cp. on fæder (bea）rme, 21, see JEGPh. vi 190) stipendüs colebat, sed eciam spolüs ex hoste quesitis, affirmare solitus, pecuniam ad milites, gloriam ad ducem redundare debere.' Cp. Hrólfssaga 43.3ff., 45.28ff. (Par.  § 9), 62.4ff. (Hrólfr Kraki); Baeda, H.E. iii, c. 14 (Oswini). -- gewyrcean (perfective), 'bring about.'

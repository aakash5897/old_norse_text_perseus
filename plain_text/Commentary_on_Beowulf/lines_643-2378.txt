 Unless we assume this to be an isolated hypermetrical half-line (cf. Intr. lxxi & n. 1), the second part of sioleða cannot be connected with ȳð (Gr.: 'seals' waves,' see Varr.). Dietrich's explanation of the noun (ZfdA. xi 416) on the basis of sol ' mud,' 'wet sand' has been rightly abandoned, especially as the testimony of the form sole, Beow. 302 (MS.) cannot be accepted. Bugge (Zs. 214) suggested connection with the stem found in Go. anasilan become quiet (silent),' Swed. dial. sil 'quiet water.' If this etymology is correct, the specific basic meaning must have been greatly widened.

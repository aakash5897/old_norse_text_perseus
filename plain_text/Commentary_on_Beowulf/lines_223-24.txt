þā wæs sund liden,/eoletes æt ende. One of the frequent summing-up remarks, Intr. lxii. eoletes, possibly representing an otherwise unrecorded OE. word, is still unexplained. We expect the gen. sing. of a noun meaning 'voyage,' 'sea,' or (perhaps) 'land.' Several conjectures are mentioned under Varr. But the list of possible guesses is not yet exhausted. Holthausen's ēoledes, i.e. ēa-lādes, fits the context well enough, but the form is questionable (lād is fem., see 228; gelād is neut., see 1410). [Cf. also Bu.

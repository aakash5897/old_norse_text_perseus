stōd on stapole. The interpretation, 'stood by the (central) pilar' (Heyne1, see L 9.4.1.48), has been largely discarded, since Hrōðgār is supposed to stand outside the hall, and such a use of on would be, at least, out of the ordinary. stapol more likely denotes "the steps leading up to the hall, or the landing at the top of the flight" (Miller, Angl. xii 398 f.) or, possibly, "an erection in the open air, standing in the area in front of the hall" (Earle, Hand-Book to Land-Charters [1888], p. 467, see also his note on Beow. 926; Middendorff, A E. Flurnamenbuch [1902], pp. 123 f). Cf. NED.: staple, sb.1 [Child MLN. viii 252 f., referring to Weinhold (L 9.32.239): 'pillar,' i.e. "the largest of the double row of pillars (in the Scandinavian hall) which came out above the house"; cf. Falk, R.-L. i 382.]

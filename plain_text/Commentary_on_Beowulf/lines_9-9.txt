oð is stressed in this line, though it is doubtful whether it was felt to alliterate (Siev. R. 282, A.M.  § 28); so 219a, 1740a, 2934a, further 2039a, 3147a (clearly type A3); but more frequently it remains unstressed, as in 56b, 66b, 100b, 145b, 296b, etc. In similar manner particles and formulas like þa, þǣr, þā gën, þā gȳt, þonan, hwīlum, hȳrde (ic), gefrægn, cwæð show variable accentuation.

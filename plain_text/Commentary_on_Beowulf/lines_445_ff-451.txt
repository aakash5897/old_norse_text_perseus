Nā þū mīnne þearft/hafalan hȳdan etc. The general sense of this passage is clear: there will be no need of funeral rites (cp. 2124 ff.). hafalan hȳdan refers either to interment (cp. Wand. 83 f.) or to the custom of covering the head of the dead with a cloth (Konrath, Arch. xcix 417; Angl. xxxvi 174 n. 2). [Heyne thought of a guard of honor (see He.-Schü.), Simrock L 3.21.199, Schücking L 4.126.1.5, of a 'lichwake.']--450a. mearcað, probably 'marks with blood,' 'stains.' [Bu. Tid. 70: 'marks with his footprints,' 'traverses'; Gr. Spr.: 'inhabits' (?).] -- 450b-51. nō ðū ymb mines ne þearft/ līces feorme leng sorgian. The rendering 'sustenance of my body' is trivial and hardly appropriate in view of Bēowulf's very brief visit; feorm is more likely 'taking care of,' 'disposal,' being another allusion to the funeral. nō . . . . leng 'no longer,' i.e. 'not a moment,' 'not at all' (Aant. 9).

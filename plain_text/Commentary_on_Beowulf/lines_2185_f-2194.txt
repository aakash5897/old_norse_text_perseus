nē hyne on medobence micles wyrðne/drihten Wedera gedōn wolde. wyre, ' having a right to,' assumes, especially in legal language, the pregnant sense of ' possessed of,' see B.-T., p. 1200, vii; Liebermann L 9.10.2. ii 1, Gloss.: wieruðe; MLN. xviii 246; hence micles wyrðne gedōn, 'put in possession of much,' i.e. 'bestow large gifts (on him).' That wereda of the MS. is a corruption of Wedera, seems all the more natural, as weoroda Dryhten is invariably applied to the 'Lord of Hosts' (Rankin, JEGPh. viii 405).

hēah is apparently left uninflected, perhaps on account of its semi-adverbial function. Or is there a shifting from the masc. to the neut. gender (see Gloss.: segn)? Cp. 2767 f. For the absence of inflexional endings of adjectives and participles qualifying a preceding noun (or pronoun), see 46b, 372b, 1126a, 2704a; H. Bauch, Die Kongruenz in der ags. Poesie, Kiel Diss., 1912, passim; Kock L 5.44.4.19 f. (numerous examples from OE. poetry); cf. also Lang.  § 25.6. -- lēton holm beran. The object hine is understood (so in 49a). -- See 3132b lēton wēg niman.

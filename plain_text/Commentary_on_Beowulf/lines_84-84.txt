āþumswēoran, MS. aþum swerian. A copulative (or 'dvanda') compound, like suhtergefæderan (see Gloss.), gisunfader (Hel.), sunufatarungo (Hildebr.), first recognized by Bugge (Tid. 45 f.). Though the existence of a form sweri（g）a showing a suffixal extension like that seen in suhtriga, suhterga is within the bounds of possibility (so Bugge, l.c.), it appears more likely that a scribe blundered, having in mind āþ and swerian. For the dat. plur. in -an, see Lang.  § 18.1.

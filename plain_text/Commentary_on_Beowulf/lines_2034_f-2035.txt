þonne hē mid fǣmnan on flett gǣð, -- /dryhtbearn Dena duguða biwenede. The pronoun hē might refer to dryhtbearn Dena, cp. 2053 f., also 2059: fǣmnan pegn, i.e. a young Dane who has accompanied the princess to her new home. (Cf. MPh. iii 255.) Kluge's interpretation of dryhtbearn as dryhtbeorn 'bridesman' (cp. dryht-ealdorman, -guma = 'paranymphus') is not called for, since there is no allusion to the wedding feast here. duguða btwenede could be considered a parenthetic clause with the substantive verb omitted (see 811). Of course, the change to bī werede (without parenthesis) would render the construction smoother.But there are other interpretational possibilities. Explaining hē 2034 with reference to Ingeld, we may regard dryhtbearn (plur.) Dena duguða brwenede as a loosely joined elliptic clause (cp. 936, 1343) indicating the cause of the king's displeasure: 'the noble sons of the Danes [are] splendidly entertained' -- provided duguða can be taken in an instrumental sense (cp. nīða 845, 1439, 2206) or is emended to duguðum (cp. 3174) ; in this case him 2036 would be dat. plur. This interpretation appears on the whole the most satisfactory one. -- Further renderings are: ' [while] a noble scion of the Danes attended upon the knights' (Heyne, Schucking), ' [that] his high lords should entertain a noble scion of the Danes' (Wyatt, Cl. Hall) [both presupposing an inexplicable change of tense]; '[with the lady,] the noble child of the Danes (dryhtbearn in apposition with fǣmnan), attended by her band' (reading duguðe) (Sedgefield) [with doubtful syntax]. -- Cf. also Rie. Zs. 404 f.; Bu. 98; Green L 6.8.5.100.

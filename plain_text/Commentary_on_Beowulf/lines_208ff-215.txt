 There is no reason for assuming an unskilful blending of two versions, or suspecting any other kind of disorder (ten Brink 32; Tr.1 137f.); sundwudu sōhte means 'went to the ship' (not 'on board'); the lagucræftig mon, i.e. Bēowulf, who like Sigfrit, Nibel. 367, is an experienced seaman, 'led the way to the shore.' The characteristic paratactic expression Fyrst forð gewāt would be, in modern usage, 'in course of time'; flota wæs on ȳðum states the 'result of an action' (Intr. lviii, lxvii); i.e., the ship, which had been ashore, was now launched (cf. Falk L 9.48.28; Cleasby-Vigfússon, Icel.-Eng. Dict.: hlunnr). An interesting parallel to this scene: Odyssey iv 778 ff.

 It has been suggested that the form hæ（ð）num (see Varr.) pertains to the tribal name Hǣðnas (ON. Het（s）ntr), which occurs Wids. 81. But why a term denoting the inhabitants of Hedemarken in Norway (according to Bugge, also the dwellers on the Jutish ' heath') should have been introduced here, has not been explained satisfactorily. Cf. Bu. 9 ff.; Chambers's note.

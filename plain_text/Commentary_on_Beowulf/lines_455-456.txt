Wēlandes geweorc. If a weapon or armor in Old Germanic literature was attributed to Wēland, this was conclusive proof of its superior workmanship and venerable associations.Such references occur in the OE. Waldere, Boethtus (prose and verse), in Middle English, Old French, and Latin texts (Binz 186 ff.). -- The admiration for the works of (unnamed) smiths (cp. Longfellow's Evangeline, 117 f.) crops out in passages like Beow. 406, 1451 f., 1681. On giganta geweore 1562 and similar expressions, see note in Angl. xxxv 260 f. The figure of this wondrous smith--the Germanic Vulcanus (Hephaistos)--symbolizing at first the marvels of metal working as they impressed the people of the stone age, was made the subject of a heroic legend, which spread from North Germany to Scandinavia and England. Evidence that the striking story of Wēland's captivity and revenge told in the Eddic Vǫlundarkviþa (in a later, expanded, and somewhat diluted form, in the þidrekssaga, chs. 57-79) was known to the Anglo-Saxons, is furnished by the allusions in the first twoOr three? See Tupper, MPh. ix (1911), 265-67. stanzas of Deor and the carving on the front of the Franks Casket (dating from the beginning of the eighth century).See Napier, Furnivall Miscellany (1901), pp. 362 ff. The tradition of Wēland was continued until modern times in connection with the motive of the 'silent trade.' It became attached to a cromlech in the White Horse valley in Berkshire called 'Wayland Smith's Cave,' or 'Forge'Formeily 'Wayland-Smith' = OE. Wēlandes smiððe (in a charter of 955 A.D.). and was used also, in a rather peculiar way, by Walter Scott in his Kenilworth (chs. 9 ff.).On Wēland see especially: Grimm D. M 312 ff. (376 ff), Jiriczek L 4-116.1 ff.; P. Maurus, Die Wielandsage in der Literatur (Munch. Beitr. z. rom. u. engl Phil xxv), 1902; M. Forster, "Stummer Handel und Wielandsage," Arch. cxix (1907), 303-8.

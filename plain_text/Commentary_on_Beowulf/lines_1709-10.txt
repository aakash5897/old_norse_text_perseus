Ne wearð Heremōd swā (namely, tō frōfre, tō helpe)/eaforum Ecgwelan. The Danes are named Ecgwela's (descendants, i.e.) men, just as the Frisians are Finn's men (eaferum 1068). For the extension of meaning, cp. the use of patronymics like Scyldingas, Scylfingas, Hrēðlingas. Nothing is gained by the emendation eafora (which has been favored by several scholars). The strange name of Ecgwela occurs nowhere else. (Cf. Notes, p. 160, n. 1.)

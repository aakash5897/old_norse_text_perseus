 A much discussed passage, see Varr. Several facts are considered well established; viz., that -beran is a blunder for (hlēor-) bergan (which, however, should not be referred to a weak fern. hlēorberge), that ferh should not be equated with fearh ('pig'), and that grummon is in need of emendation. The reading adopted in the text involves a change from the plur. Eoforlīc scionon to the sing. hēold, men (collect.), which, although somewhat harsh, is not without parallel. (MPh. iii 250, 451.) [Holthausen understands the whole passage with reference to Bēowulf alone, whose helmet is adorned with several boar-figures (l. 1453); but ferhwearde hēold/gūþmōd gummon (Holt.)-- i.e. 'Bēowulf protected his men' --would be an unduly otiose remark in this place.]--On helmets, see Antiq.  § 8; Figure 2 showing helmets surmounted by a boar; Par.  § 5, ch. 41 (Hildisvin). One such helmet has been found in England, viz. at Benty Grange, Derbyshire. As the boar was sacred to (ON.) Freyr (OE. Frēa, cf. Intr. xxiv, xxxvii), this decoration of helmets no doubt had originally a religious significance. Cf. Grimm D.M. 176 ff. (213 ff.); Gummere G. O. 433 f.; Par.  § 10, c. xlv.

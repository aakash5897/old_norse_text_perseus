fore Healfdenes hildewīsan, 'in the presence of Healfdene's battle-leader,' i.e. of Hrōðgār. We may assume that the title appertaining to Hrōðgār during his father's reign is here retained, in violation of chronology. For the use of fore, see 1215, Wids. 55, 104. Cf. Angl. xxviii 449 n. 3. [Cf. Aant. 18 ("louter onzin"); ten Brink 68; Tr.1 183: hildewīsan = -wīsum, dat. plur.]

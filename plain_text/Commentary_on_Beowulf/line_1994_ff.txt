 It has not been mentioned before that Hygelac tried to dissuade Bēowulf from his undertaking (see on the other hand, 202 ff., 415 ff.). The same motive, equally unfounded, appears in the last part, 3079 ff. -- Several so-called discrepancies between Bēowulf's own condensed version, 2000 ff, and the original account of his adventures in Denmark are easily detected. Some insignificant variations occur in 2011-13, 2147b. A shifting of emphasis (and omission of detail) is observed in 2138 f. Added details, some of which seem to have been purposely reserved for this occasion, are found in 2020 ff. (appearance of Frēawaru and everything told in connection therewith), 2076 (name Hondsciōh), 2085 ff. (Grendel's pouch), 2107 ff., 2131 f., 2157 ff.

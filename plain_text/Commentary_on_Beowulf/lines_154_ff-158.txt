feorhbealo feorran is best taken as variation of the term sibbe (Bu. 82, MPh. iii 238). By construing sibbe as dat.(instr.) and removing the comma after Deniga the meaning would be slightly modified; cf. Siev. xxix 316 f.-- 157 f. nē þǣr nǣnig witena etc. An indirect form of statement expressing the same idea as the preceding phrase, . . . fēa þingian. From the legal point of view Grendel, being guilty of murder, was under obligation to compound for it by payment; see Antiq.  § 5: Feud; Intr. lxiii n. 3.

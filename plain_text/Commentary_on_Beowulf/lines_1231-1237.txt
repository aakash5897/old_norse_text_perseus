dō (MS. doð) swā ic bidde! As Wealhþēow's speech is addressed entirely to Bēowulf, the imper. sing. was no doubt intended. (The scribal blunder is very natural indeed.) The queen's abrupt return to her favorite topic need not cause any surprise. It should he noted that her final exhortation is clothed in a formula; see Gen. 2225b: dō swā ic þē bidde!, ib. 2323b, 2465b ; Hel. 1399b.

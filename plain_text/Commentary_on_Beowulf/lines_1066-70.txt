 Scholars are not at all agreed on the punctuation and construction of these lines. A detailed survey of the various modes of interpretation has been offered by Green (LF. 4.27). See also Varr.According to the punctuation here adopted the lines announcing the recital of the Finn story, . . . . . [be] Finnes eaferum, ðā hīe se fǣr begeat, indicate, by a characteristic anticipation, the final triumph of the Danes over their enemies, see 1146 f.: Swylce . . . Finn eft begeat/sweordbealo, 1151 ff. The clause ðā hīe se fǣr begeat 1068b certainly looks like the termination of a sentence, cp. 1291b, 2872b, 2883b, 2230b. -- healgamen 1066, 'entertainment,' hence 'entertaining tale'; with ðonne 1066 cp. 880. gid oft wrecen 1065b, 'many a song was recited' (cf. Siev. xxix 571; note on 794b-5); whereupon a definite specimen of the scop's repertory is exhibited in summary and paraphrase. It may seem that the author passes very abruptly to the new theme, leaving unexpressed the thought: 'and thus he sang.' However, this difficulty vanishes, if the phrase of 1065b is understood in a more general sense: 'there was plenty of entertainment by the minstrel' (or if gid is interpreted as part or 'fit' of a lay). The insertion of be in 1068: [be] Finnes eaferum, 'about Finn's men' or 'about Finn and his men' (cp. Hrēðlingas 2960, eaforum Ecgwelan 1710; Sat. 63(?); Aant. 26) is on the whole more natural than the change to eaferan (a second object of mǣnan), though the latter would be quite possible stylistically (Angl. xxviii 443).The reading of Schücking (xxxix 106, ed.), Holthausen3, who make the Episode (direct quotation) begin at 1071, and who -- virtually returning to the practice of the earliest edd. -- place a comma after begeat, thus considering 1069-70 the continuation of the subordinate clause introduced by ðā 1068, and taking hæleð as nom. sing., is incompatible with the facts of the story, since it is the Danes, not the Frisians, who are overtaken by the sudden attack (fær) which leads to Hnæf's death.Dispensing with an emendation in 1068, Ettmüller, Grein, and others mark the beginning of the Episode at Finnes eaferum. Moreover, Grein, Bugge (29), Green construe heæleð as acc. plur. (parallel with hīe), thus arriving at the rendering: ' By Finn's men -- when onset befell them, the heroes of the Half-Danes -- Hnæf was fated to fall.' See Green, l.c., also L 6.8.5; cf. Kock2 109. This must be admitted to be a highly satisfactory interpretation, provided it can be justified on syntactical and stylistic grounds. However, it is still a question whether feallan could be construed with a dative of personal agency, especially as this intrans. verb is elsewhere used absolutely (or with an expression denoting instrumentality in a more indirect way, see 2834. f., cp. 2902, Mald. 71). Besides, the opening of the sentence by such heavy, complex phraseology (1068-69a) is decidedly harsh, and the use of the so-called proleptic pronoun hīe (cf. MPh. iii 255; Intr. lxvi) in this context is felt to be unnatural. It may be that absolute certainty is not within reach.

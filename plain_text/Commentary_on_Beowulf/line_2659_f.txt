ūrum . . . . bām, instead of unc bām or *ūre bām (cp. 2532, 596), is due to attraction. Examples of similar genit. combinations are cited by Cosijn (viii 573) and Chambers cf. P. Grdr.2 i 775. The general sense is of course : ' I will join you in the fight.' Gummere's rendering " My sword and helmet . . . for us both shall serve" is perhaps a little too precise. byrne and beaduscrūd are synonymous, see 1454a (2321 f., 3163).

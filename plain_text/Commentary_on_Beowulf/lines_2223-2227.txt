þ（ēow). A slave, a fugitive from justice, stole a costly vessel from the dragon's hoard, and upon presenting it to his master -- one of Bēowulf's men -- obtained his pardon, 2281 ff. The vessel was then sent to Bēowulf himself (2404f.). In the meantime the dragon had commenced his reign of terror. [According to Lawrence, L 4. 62a. 551, "A warrior [þegn] (not a slave), having committed a grievous crime, was forced to flee the court of which he was a member, in order to escape the vengeance of the man whom he had injured, or his kinsmen. He therefore plundered the dragon's hoard, so that he might get objects of value by means of which to compose the feud. The rings were apparently used as atonement for the crime, while the cup was given to the ruler [probably Bēowulf] who arranged the settlement." But why should that person be called a ' captive,' as Lawrence translates hæft 2408? (See Gloss.; may he have been a war prisoner ?)]

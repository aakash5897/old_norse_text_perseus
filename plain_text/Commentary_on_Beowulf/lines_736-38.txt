 Why does Bēowulf in the meantime remain lying on his bed? Presumably this is a feature of the original story (see Intr. xv, xvii; Grettissaga, chs. 65, 35) retained by the poet, though he had added the incident of a previous attack on one of the comrades (named Hondsciōh, 2076). -- under (fǣrgripum) denotes attending circumstances ('with') rather than time ('during,' Aant. 14); "set to work with his sudden snatchings "(Cl. Hall). Cp. the use of mid, 2468, and OE. Chron. A.D. 1132 (MS. E): hē fēorde mid suīcdōm.

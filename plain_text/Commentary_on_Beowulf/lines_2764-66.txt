 An apparently uncalled-for ethical reflection on the pernicious influence of gold. The curse resting on the gold (3051 ff., 3069 ff.), and the warning against the sin of avarice (1748 ff.) repreent the same general idea. (Cf. Arch. cxxvi 342 f.) The unique oferhigian has been hypothetically connected with hycgan (E. Sc., Rie. L., Heyne, Kern L 5.9), (ofer）hygd (Kluge), hēah (Bu. Tid. 59f.; ESt. xxxix 466), and hīw, see Varr. But the best hit was made by Ettmüller (Lexicon Anglosaxonicum [1851], p. 464; so Gr. Spr., Holt.), who listed it as a compound of (higjan, i.e.) hīgian ('strive,' 'hie'). The meaning of this oferhīgian is presumably ' overtake' (corresponding exactly to overhye of Northern dialects, see Dial. D.), ' get the better of,' overpower' (Ettm.: 'superare').

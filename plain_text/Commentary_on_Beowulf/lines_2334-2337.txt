ēalond. Cf. Intr. xxii, xlviii n. 4. Neither Saxo's island (Sievers) nor the islands of Zealand (Boer) or Öland (Stjer. 91 f.), but 'land bordering on water' (Bu. Tid. 68, Bu. 5). An apparently analogous use of īgland, ēalond: Andr. 15, Phoen. 9, 287, Sal. 1 was pointed out by Krapp, MPh. ii 403 f. (See also NED.: island.) Also insula is found in medieval Latin in this wider sense (cf. Beitr. xxxv 541). [Aant. 34.]

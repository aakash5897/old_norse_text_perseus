wælfāgne winter. The unique epithet of winter has been surmised to mean 'slaughter-stained' or 'deadly hostile,' 'forbidding,' or (reading wǣlfāgne)' hostile to moving waters' (cp. 1610, 1132 f.). Could wælfāg mean 'marked by troubled (orig. 'battling') waters' (see 1131b-32a)? Note scūrfāh winter, 'stormy winter' (M. Forster, St. EPh. l 172). Quite possibly wælfāg is nothing but a back-formation from wælfǣhð.

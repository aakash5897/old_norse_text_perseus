 The curse laid on the gold is first mentioned in a substantially heathen fashion, though with a saving clause of Christian tenor (3054b-57), and, later, is clothed in a Christian formula (3071-73). (Note the term hǣðen gold 2276, cp. 2216.) Cf. Angl. xxxv 269, xxxvi 171. -- The curse resting on the Niblung gold in ON. and MHG. literary tradition is a well-known parallel of the general motive. That the circumstantial history of the Niblung hoard could be traced in Beowulf was an erroneous view of Heinzel's (Anz.fdA. xv 169 f.).

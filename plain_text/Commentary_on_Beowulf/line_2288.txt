stonc ðā æfter stāne. See Gloss.: stincan. The verb form has been thought by various scholars to belong to stincan 'emit a smell' (MnE. stink) and has been credited with the unusual sense of sniffed,' 'followed the scent.' In case this interpretation is approved, (MHG.) Ortnit 570: als des wurmes houbet vernam des mannes smac might be cited as a partial parallel.

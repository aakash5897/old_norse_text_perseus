tō ðæs ðe etc., 'to the place where, as they had heard, the king . . . . distributed rings.' The familiar gefrægn- formula (1969: gefrūnon) is of course, strictly speaking, out of place here. bonan Ongenþēoes 1968 is not meant in its literal sense, since Hygelāc had performed the deed only by proxy, see Intr. xxxix; Par.  § 10: Tacitus, Germ. c. xiv. The term is suggestive of the ON. surnames Hundingsbani, Fáfnisbant (cp. Ísungs bant, Helgakv. Hund. i 21).

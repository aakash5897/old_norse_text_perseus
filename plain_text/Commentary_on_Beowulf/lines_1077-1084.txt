syþðan morgen cōm. This may or may not mean the first morning after the night attack; see Finnsb. 41.1082-85a. The purport of these lines as commonly understood is: 'he could be successful neither in the offensive nor in the defensive.' gefeohtan does not mean here (as might be expected): 'obtain by fighting'; wīg serves as 'cognate accus.' (Cf. Lorz 50; JEGPh. xiv 548.) As to forþringan, the meaning rescue' generally assigned to it is questionable -- it would indeed fit oðþringan --; the only prose instance of the verb, Ben. R. (ed. Schroer, in Gr.-Wü., Bibl. d. ags. Prosa iii) 115.7 (cp. Ormulum 6169), would favor the sense 'thrust aside,' 'crush.' Carleton Brown (MLN. xxxiv 181 ff.) suggests the change of ðegne to ðegna; thus the object of forþringan ('crush') would be 'the remnant of the thanes of the prince,' 'wēalāfe referring in 1084 as well as in 1098 to the Danish party. -- (Met.

(Cf. Lawrence, Publ. MLAss. xxx 403.) [Moore, JEGPh. xviii 208 f., like Brown, understands forþringan as 'put down,' but takes pēodnes ðegne as variation of Hengeste and considers 1084 semi-parenthetical.]

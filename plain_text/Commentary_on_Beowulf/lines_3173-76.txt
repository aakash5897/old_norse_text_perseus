 The lines setting forth the praise of BÄ“owulf by his faithful thanes sound like an echo of divine service, and closely resemble Gen. 1 ff., 15 ff., cf. ESt. xlii 327, Angl. xxxv 126f. See 'The Order of the Holy Communion' in the Book of Common Prayer (' It is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, etc.').

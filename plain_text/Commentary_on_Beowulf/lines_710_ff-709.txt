 The presentation of the Grendel fight, the first climax of the poem, shows the author's characteristic manner. (Cf. Intr. Iii, lix.) Partly excellent, vigorous narrative -- yet the story is very much interrupted by interspersed general reflections on the situation and by remarks on the persons' thoughts and emotions, which greatly lengthen it and detract from its effectiveness. The corresponding combat of Grettir (Intr. xiv f.) is a good deal shorter, and also more direct and realistic.

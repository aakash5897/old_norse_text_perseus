The unique oferhigian has been hypothetically connected with hycgan (E. Sc., Rie. L., Heyne, Kern L 5.9), (ofer\uff09hygd (Kluge), h\u0113ah (Bu. Tid. 59f.; ESt. xxxix 466), and h\u012bw, see Varr. But the best hit was made by Ettm\u00fcller (Lexicon Anglosaxonicum [1851], p. 464; so Gr. Spr., Holt.), who listed it as a compound of (higjan, i.e.) h\u012bgian ('strive,' 'hie'). The meaning of this oferh\u012bgian is presumably ' overtake' (corresponding exactly to overhye of Northern dialects, see Dial. D.), ' get the better of,' overpower' (Ettm.: 'superare')."}}

Several facts are considered well established; viz., that -beran is a blunder for (hl\u0113or-) bergan (which, however, should not be referred to a weak fern. hl\u0113orberge), that ferh should not be equated with fearh ('pig'), and that grummon is in need of emendation. The reading adopted in the text involves a change from the plur. Eoforl\u012bc scionon to the sing. h\u0113old, men (collect.), which, although somewhat harsh, is not without parallel. (MPh. iii 250, 451.) [Holthausen understands the whole passage with reference to B\u0113owulf alone, whose helmet is adorned with several boar-figures (l. 1453); but ferhwearde h\u0113old/g\u016b\u00fem\u014dd gummon (Holt.)-- i.e. 'B\u0113owulf protected his men' --would be an unduly otiose remark in this place.]--On helmets, see Antiq.  \u00a7 8; Figure 2 showing helmets surmounted by a boar; Par.  \u00a7 5, ch. 41 (Hildisvin). One such helmet has been found in England, viz. at Benty Grange, Derbyshire. As the boar was sacred to (ON.) Freyr (OE. Fr\u0113a, cf. Intr. xxiv, xxxvii), this decoration of helmets no doubt had originally a religious significance. Cf. Grimm D.M. 176 ff. (213 ff.); Gummere G. O. 433 f.; Par.  \u00a7 10, c. xlv."}}

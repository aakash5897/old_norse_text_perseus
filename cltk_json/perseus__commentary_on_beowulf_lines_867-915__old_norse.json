Starting with a lay of praise concerning B\u0113owulf's exploit, which has just been extolled by the warriors in informal, yet highly eloquent language (856-61), the court poet, well versed in ancient heroic lore, proceeds to recite the adventures of Sigemund, thus raising B\u0113owulf, as it were, to the rank of pre-eminent Germanic heroes. From indirect discourse the account passes almost imperceptibly to direct statement, and when the Herem\u014dd theme is taken up, we feel like questioning whether Hr\u014d\u00f0g\u0101r's thane has not been altogether forgotten by the Ags. poet.--We have here a valuable testimony both of the improvisation of lays in connection with great, stirring events and of the circulation of famous short epic poems comparable in scale to The Fight at Finnsburg."}}

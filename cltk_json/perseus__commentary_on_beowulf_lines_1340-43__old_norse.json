The phrase f\u01e3h\u00f0e st\u01e3lan (cp. Gen. 1351 f.), in all probability, denotes 'avenge hostility,' 'retaliate' (in the prosecution of a feud), cf. Kock 229 ff. There appears to be no warrant for the meaning 'institute,' 'carry on' attributed to st\u01e3lan (thus, e.g., Aant. 23). hre\u00feerbealo hearde could be regarded as acc., parallel with faaeligmacr;h\u00f0e, but this would result in a rather unnatural breaking up of the context (1340-44). Also the construction of gr\u0113ote\u00fe with hre\u00feerbealo hearde as object would be awkward and questionable. We may venture to take the combination as a loosely connected, semi-exclamatory noun phrase, cp. 936, 2035. -- 1342. \u00e6fter sincgyfan. \u00c6schere, who occupied an exalted position, receives a title fit for a king."}}

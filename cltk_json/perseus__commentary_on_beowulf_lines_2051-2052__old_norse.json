We may imagine that the battle turned after Wi\u00f0ergyld, a great leader, was slain. (It has been conjectuied that he was the father of the young warrior, 2044, see G. W. Mead, MLN. xxxii 435 f.) The same name, though apparently not applied to a Bard warrior, occurs Wids. 124. A common noun wi\u00f0ergyld (' requital') is nowhere found."}}

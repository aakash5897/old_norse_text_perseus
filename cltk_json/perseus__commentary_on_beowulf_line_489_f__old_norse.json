See Varr. The apparent metrical objection to an imper. ons\u01e3l, which prompted the reading on s\u01e3l\uff08um), has been shown by Bright to be largely imaginary, the occurrence of imperatives under the first metrical stress of the second half-line being not infrequent. For such imperatives taking precedence, in alliteration, of a following noun, see Finnsb. (11a), 11b, Gen. 1513b, (Andr. 914a), Gr.-Wu. 11 219.38b; similarly, Wald. i. 22b, Gen. 1916b, Andr. 1212b (cf. Siev. A. M.  \u00a7 \u00a7 24.3, 27). On the other hand, no really appropriate function of on s\u01e3l can be presented. Bright's rendering, \"do thou, victory-famous one, disclose to these men what thou hast in mind\" (emend. m\u0113tto, found in no other place, but cp. oferm\u0113tto), makes very satisfactory sense; for the figurative meaning of ons\u01e3lan, see onl\u016bcan 259, onbindan 501; for the use of the dative, cp. Andr. 171 f., 315 f. In fact, the king's exhortation, 'enjoy yourself and speak your mind freely,' leaves nothing to be desired. But the assumption of an adj. sigehr\u0113\u00f0 (a 'possessive compound,' so He.1-3, Tr.1 154 & ed.) is open to doubt. May not the noun sigehr\u0113\u00f0 refer to the hero's glorious deeds which he is expected to relate ? Dietrich and Grein Spr. took meoto for a fem. noun, 'meditation,' 'thoughts' (cp. Go. mit\u014dn, wk. v. 2), Grein2, Bu. Tid. 292, Tr.1 154, for the plur. of a neut. noun met (cp. gemet), 'measure,' 'etiquette' (Bu.. 'courtly words,' cf. He.1-3 [Leo]). That an unrecorded noun is hidden in the MS. reading is by no means improbable. [Moore, JEGPh. xviii 206 (like Korner, ESt. ii 251, and Kock2 105): \"think of good fortune (on s\u01e3l meoto), victory-renown to men.\" ]"}}

The apparent subordination of fate to God (Intr. xlix) does not justify us in recognizing in this passage the influence of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy (as Earle does, see his note; H. F. Stewart, Boethius, an Essay [1891], pp. 163 ff.). Nor do we need to follow the earlier dissecting critics who condemned this passage as an interpolation.

There is no doubt that the m\u0113ce (2047) is meant. It would not seem impossible to credit b\u0113ah, 'ring,' then 'ornament,' 'precious thing' (b\u0113agas 'things of value,' 80, 523, 2635) with the same development of sense as is seen in the term m\u0101\u00f0\u00feum, 'treasure,' 'anything precious,' which is applied to a sword (see 1528, 2055). But it is certainly simpler to interpret b\u0113ag as 'hilt-ring,' see Stjer. 25, Gloss.: fetelhilt, bindan."}}

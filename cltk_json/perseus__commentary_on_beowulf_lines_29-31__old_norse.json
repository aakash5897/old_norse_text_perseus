(Cf. Siev. xxix 308, Kock2 101. See ll. 2802 ff., 3140.) L. 31, l\u0113of landfruma lange \u0101hte, added paiatactically, conveys the very appropriate idea: 'his had been a long reign.' (Cp. Helgakv. Hund. i 10; for the paratactic clause, cp. OE. Chron. A.D. 871: Ond \u00fe\u00e6s ofer Eastron gef\u014dr \u00c6\u00feer\u0113d cyning, ond h\u0113 r\u012bcsode f\u012bf g\u0113ar.) The implied object of \u0101hie (it need not be expressed, see 2208b) is h\u012b, cp. 522, 2732, 911, 2751; folc\u0101gend\uff08e). Practically the same interpretation would result from construing 31a as a variation of 30b (as to the brief clause lange \u0101hte, cp. 1913b). [It would not seem impossible to regard 31 as parallel to 30, i.e. dependent on \u00feenden; in that case the somewhat peculiar lange might be compared to oft, 2867.] Cf. MPh. iii 446."}}

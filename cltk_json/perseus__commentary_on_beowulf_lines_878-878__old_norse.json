Though ne wiston admits of being construed with the genitive (see 681), it is probable that its use here is due mainly to the partitive idea suggested by unc\u016b\u00fees fela, 876. The \u00fe\u0101ra \u00fee combination regularly agrees with the syntactical requirements of the governing clause, cf. Delbruck L 6.13. 2.682 f."}}

The general sense of these lines -- which do not stand in need of alteration -- is: 'As a rule, the murderous spear will rest only for a short time under such circumstances.' seldan, ' in rare instances,' expresses in a modified form the same idea as l\u0233tle bw\u012ble; cf. ESt. xliv 125f. Kock's able interpretation (Angl. xxvii 233 ff.): 'As a rule, it seldom happens that (seldan hw\u01e3r, cp. wundur hw\u0101r 3062) the spear rests when some time has elapsed . . .' does not take into consideration the natural meaning of l\u0233tle hw\u012ble (cp. 2097, 2240). s\u0113o br\u0233d, the bride (in question), cp. 943, 1758, Hel. 310; no direct reference to Fr\u0113awaru."}}

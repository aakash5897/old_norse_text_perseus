This passage remains, in Bugge's words, a ' locus desperatus.' Cosijn's rendering 'by no means had B\u0113owulf with gold-greedy eyes before [his death] surveyed the owner's [i.e. the dragon's] inheritance more accurately' (Aant. 41) makes at least passable sense. (Cp. 2748.) Does the compar. gearwor stand for the positive ? -- Or is the meaning this that 'he had not seen the treasure before more completely than now [at his death],' implying that he had never seen it in its entirety ? In its general intent the statement is evidently a declaration of Beowulf's virtual innocence. -- Decidedly tempting is the emendation gold\u01e3hte. The interpretation of \u0101gend as a term for God seems without foundation. [Cf. further: Bu. Tid. 62 f.; Mull. xiv 241; Rie.

One of the frequent summing-up remarks, Intr. lxii. eoletes, possibly representing an otherwise unrecorded OE. word, is still unexplained. We expect the gen. sing. of a noun meaning 'voyage,' 'sea,' or (perhaps) 'land.' Several conjectures are mentioned under Varr. But the list of possible guesses is not yet exhausted. Holthausen's \u0113oledes, i.e. \u0113a-l\u0101des, fits the context well enough, but the form is questionable (l\u0101d is fem., see 228; gel\u0101d is neut., see 1410). [Cf. also Bu. Tid. 46f.; Brenner, ESt. iv 139; Tr.1 139; Sed., MLR. v 286.]"}}

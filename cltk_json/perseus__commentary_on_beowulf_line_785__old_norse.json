As of wealle, in all probability, denotes the standpoint of the subject of geh\u0233rdon (Sievers, Beitr. xii 192; see l. 229), the meaning appears to be that the Danes heard the wailing from the wall(s) of their sleeping apartments. (We might translate: 'through the walls.') Sievers supposed that they had fled in terror to the shore, but this would seem a little far-fetched. [Tinker (MLN. xxiii 240), who connects of wealle with the object, is enabled to render: \"who heard the howling in the house (Heorot).\"]"}}

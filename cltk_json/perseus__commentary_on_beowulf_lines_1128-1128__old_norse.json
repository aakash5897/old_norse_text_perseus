The unique epithet of winter has been surmised to mean 'slaughter-stained' or 'deadly hostile,' 'forbidding,' or (reading w\u01e3lf\u0101gne)' hostile to moving waters' (cp. 1610, 1132 f.). Could w\u00e6lf\u0101g mean 'marked by troubled (orig. 'battling') waters' (see 1131b-32a)? Note sc\u016brf\u0101h winter, 'stormy winter' (M. Forster, St. EPh. l 172).

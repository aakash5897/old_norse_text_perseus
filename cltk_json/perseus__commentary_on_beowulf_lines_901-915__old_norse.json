The main point of the story referred to in these two allusive passages is that Herem\u014dd was a strong, valiant hero, pre-eminent among his fellows, giving promise of a brilliant career, but subsequently proved a bad ruler, cruel and stingy, and having become a burden to his people, ended miserably. A minor feature, which in the Beowulf itself remains obscure, is connected with certain events preceding his accession (907-13).M\u00fcllenhoff looked upon Herem\u014dd as a mere allegorical personification setting forth the dangers of here-m\u014dd, i.e. 'warlike disposition.'Similarly ten Brink. But later studies have shown him to be a definite figure in Danish historical-legendary tradition.A slight similarity is found in the case of the Danish king Harald Hildetan, who became 'ob senecram severitatemque civibus . . onustus' and devised means for an honorable death (Saxo vii 255). A Vergilian parallel is the cruel tyrant Mezentius, who was driven out of the land by the 'fessi cives,' \u00c6n. viii 481 ff. Thus Saxo tells of Olo who was a wonderfully strong and gifted youth, but later showed himself a cruel and unrighteous king, so that twelve generals ('duces'), moved by the distress of their country, plotted against his life and induced Starcatherus to kill the king while alone at the bath (viii 265). This Olo as well as the figure of Olavus, on whom the three goddesses of fate bestowed 'beauty and favor in the eyes of men,' 'the virtue of generosity,' but also 'the vice of niggardliness' (Saxo vi 181), is identical with the Danish king Ali inn fr&\u00b4empty;fkni,Cp. Hyndl. 14 (Par.  \u00a74). who after a long, vigorous reign was killed by Starka\u00f0r (Rnglingasaga, ch. 25 (29); Skj\u01ebldungasaga, ch. 9). In view of the fact, however, that according to the Nornagests\u00fe\u00e1ttr (cir. 1300 A.D.) and the Egils Saga ok \u00c1lmundar (14th century) it is King Arm\u00f3\u00f0r that was slain by Starka\u00f0r while bathing, there is good reason to believe (with Bugge) that the name Herem\u014dd applied to this saga figure in Beowulf goes back to true old Danish legend, the names Herem\u014dd (ON. Herm\u00f3\u00f0r) and Arm\u00f3\u00f0r (\u00c1r-?) being insignificant variations.Another version of the story (transferred to Lotherus), which is apt to throw light on the hidden meaning of ll. 907-13, occurs in Saxo i 11. (A brief mention in the Annale Ryenses, Par.  \u00a7 8.5.) Of the two sons of Dan--the fabulous eponymous ancestor of the Danish kings -- 'HumblusTranslation by Elton. was elected king at his father's. death; but [later on] by the malice of ensuing fate . . . . he was taken by Lotherus in war, and bought his life by yielding up his crown . . . . . But Lotherus played the king as insupportably as he had played the soldier, inaugurating his reign straightway with arrogance and crime; for he counted it uprightness to strip all the most eminent of life or goods, and to clear his country of its loyal citizens, thinking all his equals in birth his rivals for the crown. He was soon chastised for his wickedness; for he met his end in an insurrection of his country; which had once bestowed on him his kingdom, and now bereft him of his life.' Putting together the veiled allusion of the last clause ('which had once bestowed on him his kingdom') and Beow. 907 ff., Sievers concluded that Lotherus gained the throne through the support of an active minority of the people which had been from the beginning in favor of his succession and regretted (\u01e3rran m\u01e3lum 907) the turn Danish affairs had taken under the rule of his [weaker] brother.A faint and confused echo of this narrative has been discovered by Sarrazin (Angl. xix 392 ff.) in the Scondia illustrata of the Swedish chronicler Johannes Messenius (beginning of the 7th century). 'Lotherus igitur Danorum rex' -- we are informed -- 'ope suorum propter nimiam destitutus tyrannidem, superatusque in Jutiam profugit . . . . .' He returns from this exile, slays the rival king BalderusThe fact that in Gylfaginning (Prose Edda), ch. 48, Herm\u00f3r\u00f0r -- the same one as the '\u00d3\u00f0inn hero' of Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0 -- appears as (\u00d3\u00f0m's son and) Baldr's brother, furnishes additional proof of the identity of Lother and Herem\u014dd. and temporarily regains possession of his kingdom, but loses his life in a war of revenge instigated by Othinus.That the Ags. poet recognized Herem\u014dd as a Danish king, is seen from \u0113pel Scyldinga 913 and \u0100r-Scyldingum 1710 (Scyldingas being used in the wider sense of 'Danes,' without regard to the Scyld dynasty). Moreover, both in Ags. and Norse genealogies (Par.  \u00a7 \u00a7 1.1 & 2, 5, 8. 1, cp. 1.4), Herem\u014dd figures as the father, i.e. predecessor of Scyld(wa) (Skj\u01ebldr), just as Saxo (i 11) represents Scioldus as Lotherus' son and follower on the Danish throne. More precisely, he belonged to an earlier line of kings,Was Ecgwela (1710) supposed to be the founder of this line? Sarrazin (Angl. xix 396) conjectured Herem\u014dd to be the leader of the Heruli who were expelled by the Danes. Moller (100 ff.) thought him identical with Finn. Koegel and Binz regarded him as an Anglian hero. and it was after his fall that the Danes endured distress -- aldorl\u0113ase 15, until the God-sent Scyld inaugurated a new dynasty.The coupling .of Herem\u014dd and Sigemund as heroes of greatest renown springs from a Scandinavian tradition (which may have arisen even before Hererm\u014dd was given a place among the Danish kings). This is proved by Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0 2 (Par.  \u00a7 4) and, indirectly, by a comparison of H\u00e1konarm\u00e1l, l. 38See Corp. Poet. Bor. i 264. with Eir\u00edksm\u00e1l, l. 16See above, p. 155, n. 3. (Chadwick, The Cult of Othin (1899), p. 51).In contrast with the Sigemund episode, which is introduced as a pure heroic tale, our author has infused into the Herem\u014dd story a strong spirit of Christian moralization (cf. Angl. xxxv 475, 479 f.), adding besides a touch of sentimental softness (904 f., 907, 909). In both of the passages Herem\u014dd is made to serve as a foil to the exemplary B\u0113owulf."}}

Now Grettir woke up a little after, and then spake Thorstein:\"I have seen thine arms, kinsman,\" said he, \"and I deem it nowise wonderful, though thy strokes fall heavy on many, for no man's arms have I seen like thine.\"\"Thou mayst know well enough,\" said Grettir, \"that I should not have brought such things to pass as I have wrought, if I were not well knit.\"\"Better should I deem it,\" said Thorstein, \"if they were slenderer and somewhat luckier withal.\"Grettir said, \"True it is, as folk say, No man makes himself; but let me see thine arms,\" said he.Thorstein did so; he was the longest and gauntest of men; and Grettir laughed, and said,\"No need to look at that longer; hooked together are the ribs in thee; nor, methinks, have I ever seen such tongs as thou bearest about, and I deem thee to be scarce of a woman's strength.\"\"That may be,\" said Thorstein; \"yet shalt thou know that these same thin arms shall avenge thee, else shalt thou never be avenged; who may know what shall be, when all is over and done?\"No more is told of their talk together; the spring wore on, and Grettir took ship in the summer. The brothers parted in friendship, and saw each other never after."}}

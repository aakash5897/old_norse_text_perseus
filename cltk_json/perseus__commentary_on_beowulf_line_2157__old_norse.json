' That I should first declare to thee his goodwill ' (Schr6er, Angl. xiii 342 f., Sedgefield, Cl. Hall) would be an altogether supererogatory declaration. Considering the regular way of introducing indirect discourse (see Intr. lvi), it appears that 2157 must contain a general statement of similar import to that of the following lines introduced by cw\u00e6\u00f0. The noun \u0113st may be 'bequest,' 'bequeathing' (cp. syllan 2160, almost = unnan), and his . . . \u0113st may express ' its transmission,' i.e. its history (in which case the use of the adverb \u01e3rest suggests that of \u00e6fter in 12, 2731), cf. MPh. iii 264, 462f. Or \u0113st may be interpreted as 'glacious gift,' -- \"that I should describe to thee his gracious gift \" (B - T. Suppl.). The separation of his from \u0113st might possibly be cited in favor of the former explanation (see 2579). -- When Grettir's mother presented him with a sword, she said: This sword was owned by J\u01ebkull, my father's father, and the earlier Vatnsdal men, in whose hands it was blessed with victory. I give it to you; use it well.' (Grettissaga, ch. 17.)"}}

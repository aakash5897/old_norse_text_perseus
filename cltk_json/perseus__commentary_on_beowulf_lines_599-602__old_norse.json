Lat. 'mittere Orco, umbris,' etc. (e.g. \u00c6neid ix 785, xi 81). Yet the meaning of 'feasting' formerly (orig. by Leo in Heyne1) attributed to it -- on the basis of the noun sand 'dish of food,' 'repast' ('that which is sent to the table') --, though generally given up at present, may be right after all."}}

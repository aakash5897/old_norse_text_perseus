The pronoun h\u0113 might refer to dryhtbearn Dena, cp. 2053 f., also 2059: f\u01e3mnan pegn, i.e. a young Dane who has accompanied the princess to her new home. (Cf. MPh. iii 255.) Kluge's interpretation of dryhtbearn as dryhtbeorn 'bridesman' (cp. dryht-ealdorman, -guma = 'paranymphus') is not called for, since there is no allusion to the wedding feast here. dugu\u00f0a btwenede could be considered a parenthetic clause with the substantive verb omitted (see 811). Of course, the change to b\u012b werede (without parenthesis) would render the construction smoother.But there are other interpretational possibilities. Explaining h\u0113 2034 with reference to Ingeld, we may regard dryhtbearn (plur.) Dena dugu\u00f0a brwenede as a loosely joined elliptic clause (cp. 936, 1343) indicating the cause of the king's displeasure: 'the noble sons of the Danes [are] splendidly entertained' -- provided dugu\u00f0a can be taken in an instrumental sense (cp. n\u012b\u00f0a 845, 1439, 2206) or is emended to dugu\u00f0um (cp. 3174) ; in this case him 2036 would be dat. plur. This interpretation appears on the whole the most satisfactory one. -- Further renderings are: ' [while] a noble scion of the Danes attended upon the knights' (Heyne, Schucking), ' [that] his high lords should entertain a noble scion of the Danes' (Wyatt, Cl. Hall) [both presupposing an inexplicable change of tense]; '[with the lady,] the noble child of the Danes (dryhtbearn in apposition with f\u01e3mnan), attended by her band' (reading dugu\u00f0e) (Sedgefield) [with doubtful syntax]. -- Cf. also Rie. Zs. 404 f.; Bu. 98; Green L 6.8.5.100."}}

Probably \u00e6ttren ellorg\u01e3st is parallel with bl\u014dd (logical adjunct and headword forming the terms of variation), though \u00e6ttren could be (and usually is) construed as predicative adj., parallel with h\u0101t (cp. 49 f., 2209 f ). Cf. MPh. iii 239. The reference is to Grendel, just as in 1614 Grendel's head is meant."}}

Even the commonly accepted form of 984b, foran \u01e3ghwylc w\u00e6s (advocated by Sievers, ix 138, R. 232, in place of foran \u01e3ghwylc [with w\u00e6s added to the following l.] as printed by Grein, Heyne, et al.), has been assailed on syntactical grounds by Ries (L 6.12.2.378 f.), who suggests, as alternatives, w\u00e6s foran \u01e3ghwylc or foran w\u00e6r \u01e3ghwylc. The retention of the MS. reading steda n\u00e6gla gehwylc 985a, 'each of the places of the nails' (Sch\u00fccking, Chambers), carries no conviction. On the other hand, gehwyle may very well be a thoughtless repetition like hilde of 986. Regarding handsporu 986, it seems that spora, elsewhere a wk. masc., has passed over into the fem. class (cf. Siev.  \u00a7 278 n. 1). The form egl of the MS. has been taken by many scholars (e.g., Kemble, Grein, Heyne, Sedgefield, Chambers) as a noun, 'spike,' 'talon' (Kemble: 'molestia'), but the only substantiated meanings of egl, egle (the latter being the usual form) are 'awn' ('ail'), 'beard of barley' (B.-T. Suppl.), 'mote' (Luke 6. 41 f.). As to eglu, see T.C.  \u00a7 25. [Cf. also Aant. 17; Tr.1 176-8; Arch. cxv 179.]"}}

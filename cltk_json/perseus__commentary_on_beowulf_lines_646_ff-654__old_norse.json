(Cf. also Schuchardt L 6.14.2.25.) Ll. 648 ff. plainly mean: 'from the time that they could see the light of the sun, until (o\u00fe \u00f0e) night came'; exactly as Brun. 13 ff. (si\u00f0\u00f0an . . . o\u00f0 . . .). Thus, the meaning (of o\u00fe \u00f0e, or o\u00fe\u00f0e) 'until' (so some earlier edd., like Grein, Arnold, cf. Heyne1-3) need not be given up for Bugge's op\u00f0e= 'and' (i.e., a variant of the regular 'or,' see Bu. Tid. 57, cf. E. tr.). Nor do we need to assume a lacuna (Grein, cf. Gru.). In other words, the king knew that fight had been in Grendel's mind all day long; Grendel had been waiting from morning till night to renew his attacks in the hall, just as the dragon -- hordweard onb\u0101d/earfo\u00f0lice, o\u00f0 \u00f0\u00e6t \u01e3fen cw\u014dm 2302 f. -- Close parallels to the use of t\u014d (\u00fe\u01e3m h\u0113ahsele) are found in 1990, 1207. Whether we consider \u0101hl\u00e6can as 'dat. used as instr.' (Sedgefield), as 'dat. of personal agency' (Green L 6.8.5.98: \"a fight was contemplated by the monster\"), or a variety of the dat. of interest (cp. Lat. 'mihi consilium captum est,' see also Heusler, Altisl. Elementarbuch  \u00a7 383), is immaterial to the general interpretation of the context. [Cf. also Bu. 89; ten Brink 52; Tr.1 160.]"}}

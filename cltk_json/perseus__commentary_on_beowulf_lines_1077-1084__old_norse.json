This may or may not mean the first morning after the night attack; see Finnsb. 41.1082-85a. The purport of these lines as commonly understood is: 'he could be successful neither in the offensive nor in the defensive.' gefeohtan does not mean here (as might be expected): 'obtain by fighting'; w\u012bg serves as 'cognate accus.' (Cf. Lorz 50; JEGPh. xiv 548.) As to for\u00feringan, the meaning rescue' generally assigned to it is questionable -- it would indeed fit o\u00f0\u00feringan --; the only prose instance of the verb, Ben. R. (ed. Schroer, in Gr.-W\u00fc., Bibl. d. ags. Prosa iii) 115.7 (cp. Ormulum 6169), would favor the sense 'thrust aside,' 'crush.'

[Moore, JEGPh. xviii 208 f., like Brown, understands for\u00feringan as 'put down,' but takes p\u0113odnes \u00f0egne as variation of Hengeste and considers 1084 semi-parenthetical.]"}}

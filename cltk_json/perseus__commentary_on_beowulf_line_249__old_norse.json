Bugge's explanation (Tid. 290 f.) of seldguma as 'hall-man,' 'retainer' (cp. ON. b\u00faskarl) is the most convincing one; 'that is not a [mere] retainer [but a chief himself].' Two of the other meanings attributed to it, viz. 'stay-at-home' (Grein), 'a man who possesses only a small homestead' (Heynez2, et al., similarly F\u00f6rster [Beibl. xiii 168 n. 2], who thought of equating it with cotsetla 'cottager'), are rendered improbable by the fact that OE. seld (s\u00e6ld) denotes a (royal) hall, palace. Bright's emendation is \u00fe\u00e6t [or: \u00fe\u00e6t is (?)] seldguma (cp. seldan, 'seldom,' see Varr.), 'that is a lare, or superior, man', makes admirable sense, but the formation proposed is open to doubt, since the other seld- compounds cited in support (seld-c\u016b\u00f0, -s\u012bene, -cyme, -hwanne) are of a different order, showing a more or less adverbial function of the first element."}}

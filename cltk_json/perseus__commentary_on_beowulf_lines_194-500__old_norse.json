The name Unfer\u00f0, i.e., more properly, Unfri\u00f0, 'mar-peace,'Hardly Unfer\uff08h\uff09\u00f0, 'nonsense.' (For the interchange of -fer\u00f0 and -fri\u00f0 see Bulb.  \u00a7 572.)--The erroneous MS. spelling Hunfer\u00f0 was apparently suggested by the H\u016bn- compounds, e.g. H\u016bnl\u0101f (see 1143); Hunfer\u00fe, OE. Chron. A.D. 744 (MS. E: Unfer\u00f0), A.D. 754, MS. B: H\u00fanfer\u00fe. it should be noted, appears to have been coined on English soil, such descriptive abstract appellations pointing to West Germanic rather than Scandinavian origin.Cp. Unw\u0113n (Wids. 114); Wonr\u0113d (Beow. 2971); Ofif\u014dr; W\u012bds\u012b\u00f0; OHG. Unfrid. On the other hand, it has been suggestedBy Deurschbein, GRM. i 114. It is strongly opposed by Olson, MPh. xi 419 ff. that his peculiar position would seem to reflect conditions at the Irish courts where the fili (members of the learned poets' guild) enjoyed a remarkable influence and surprising freedom of speech.In his behavior to B\u0113owulf, Unfer\u00f0 shows a noteworthy similarity to Drances, \u00c6neid xi 336 ff.; also B\u0113owulf's reply may be compared to that of Turnus, ib. xi 376 ff. (Earle 126 ; Arch. cxxvi 340 f.). Attention has also been called to the (decidedly less civilized) word-combat between Gu\u00femundr and Sinfj\u01ebtli in the Eddic lays of Helgi Hundingsbani i 33 ff., ii 22 ff. (Bugge L 4.84.163).--The taunting and trying of strangers at entertainments is not unknown in ON. sagas; see, e.g., Gunnlaugssaga, ch. 5, cp. Hr\u00f3lfssaga, ch. 23. (Also Odyssey viii 158 ff.) But Unfer\u00f0's disrespectful treatment of B\u0113owulf contrasts strangely with the dignified courtesy reigning at Hr\u014d\u00f0g\u0101r's court.What the title \u00feyle applied to Unfer\u00f0 (1165, 1456) meant, cannot be determined with certainty. The \u00feyle (ON. pulr\uff09See the discussions of Mullenhoff, Deutsche Altertumskunde v 89 ff., Fr. Kauffmann in Philologische Studien: Festgabe f\u00fcr E. Sievers, pp. 159 ff., Koegel in P. Grdr.2 iia, p. 33; Mogk, ib., p. 575; Heusler, R.-L. i 443 f.; Larson L 9.19.120 f. (convenient summary); B. C. Williams, Gnomic Poetry in Anglo-Saxon, pp. 72 ff. -- As a proper name, \u00feyle occurs Wids. 24. has been variously described as a sage, orator, poet of note, historiologer, major domus, or the king's right-hand man. The OE. noun occurs several times as the rendering of 'orator,' besides the compound \u00feelcr\u00e6ft =' rethorica' (see B.-T.); hence the meanings of 'orator,' 'spokesman,' 'official entertainer' suggest themselves as applicable to the situation in the Beowulf. As to the \u00feulr, the characteristics of his office seem to have been \"age, wisdom, extended knowledge, and a seat of honor\" (Laron). Also Unfer\u00f0 has a seat of distinction: \u00e6t f\u012boum s\u00e6t fr\u0113an Scyldinga (500, 166)--like the scop of The Fates of Men, 80 ff.W. H. Stevenson in his edition of Asser's Life of King Alfred (Oxford, 1904), p. 165 connects the office of Unfer\u00f0 with that of a pedisequus, pedisecus, --a term appearing occasionally in the earlier charters as the name of an important official . . . \" B. C. Williams (l. c.) compares Unfer\u00f0 to the later court fools And by his reference to the Breca incident he shows that he is the best informed man at the court.He is depicted by our poet as a sharp-witted (589) court official of undoubted influence and a reputation for valor (1166 f.), which he is jealously (501 ff.) anxious to guard. He has laid himself open to the terrible charge of fratricide (587 ff., 1167 f.), which, strange to say, does not seem to have imperiled his prominent position at the court,That Unfer\u00f0 remained unmolested in spite of the murder, because there can be no 'feud' within one and the same family (cp. 2441 ff.), is scarcely believable. although he is certain -- so the Christian author informs us through the mouth of B\u0113owulf (588 f.) -- to receive his punishment in hell (cf. Angl. xxxv 133, 265).In noteworthy contrast with the original conception of his character as expressed by his name, Unfer\u00f0 evinces a spirit of generosity, courtesy, and sportsmanlike fairness toward B\u0113owulf when the latter has demonstrated his superiority (1455 ff., 1807 ff.), -- a feature obviously added by the poet himself.The speeches of Unfer\u00f0 (506-528) and B\u0113owulf (530-606), if rather ornate considering the occasion, show the style of the poem at its best. The admirable use of variation, the abundance of sea terms (508 ff.), the strong description of the scene (545 ff., cp. Wand. 101 ff.) chiming in with the hardy spirit of the Northern heroes are conspicuous features of this famous passage."}}

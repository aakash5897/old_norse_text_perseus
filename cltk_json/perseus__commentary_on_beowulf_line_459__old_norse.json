Chr. 617, Beosw. 78, 193, 1119, 2328, etc.). See M\u00fcllenhoff, Anz. fd A. iii 179, MLN. xvi 15, MPh. iii 262. The feud was probably considered memorable on account of the persons or circumstances connected with it. -- The chief alternative renderings advocated are: 'fought the greatest fight' (see Kock 226 f), and 'fought out the greatest feud' (see Lorz 64; Chambers). The former, while not entirely impossible (cp. 1083), ignores the customary perfective function of gesl\u0113an. The latter is unconvincing, since the slaying of Hea\u00feol\u0101f by no means finishes the feud. Moreover, Hi\u014d\u00f0g\u0101r is not interested primarily in relating a great exploit of Ecg\u00fe\u0113ow's, but means to emphasize the friendly relations existing between the Danes and Geats, his main point being the subsequent settlement of that feud (\u00fe\u0101 [demonstr.] f\u01e3b\u00f0e 470)."}}

So the Danes need not fear a recurrence of the terrible 'lordless' time they had experienced before Scyld came, i.e., after the fall of Herem\u014dd (see note on 901-915). [Also Saxo's Scioldus had a son, named 'Gram, whose wondrous parts savored so strongly of his father's virtues, that he was deemed to tread in their very footsteps' (i 12). However, this parallelism may be purely accidental.]"}}

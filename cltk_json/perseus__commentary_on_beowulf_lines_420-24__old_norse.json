In the latter case, the slaying of the niceras could refer to the Breca episode, 549 ff. (cp. 567 ff. (1428 f.) with 423a). By the term niceras (cp. s\u01e3dracan 1426, wyrmas ond wild\u00ebor 1430, wundra . . fela 1509; 1510, 558, 549) were understood strange sea-beasts of some kinds; the definite sense of 'walrus,' 'hippopotamus' (Rie. Zs. 388 f., Bu.Zs. 197) need not be looked for in the Beowulf. The fight against giants, five of whom were bound, seems reminiscent of folk-tales. Did B\u0113owulf bring those five with him as prisoners? (Cf. Panzer 44 ff., 58 ff.) -- 423. The subject of \u0101hsodon is niceras."}}

'He was not allowed to approach the throne (of God, cp. Chr. 572), the sacred one (lit.: the precious thing), [appearing] in the presence of the Lord, nor did he (God) take thought of him' (cf. Angl. xxxv 254). The curse resting on Grendel is complete. witan is to be understood in the well-established sense of 'be conscious of,' 'feel,' 'show'; cp. Wand. 27: [min] mine wisse. See JEGPh. viii 254 f. --It is obvious that these two lines could have been easily interpolated; see Intr. cxvi. --The difficulties experienced in the interpretation of this passage arise chiefly from (1) the ambiguity of gifst\u014dl, which could denote either God's or Hr\u014d\u00f0g\u0101r's throne, (2) the possibility of rendering gr\u0113tan either by 'approach' or 'attack,' (3) the uncertainty as to the real force of myne. (The possibility of identifying h\u0113 with the king is too remote to be seriously considered.) In case gifst\u014dl is understood as Hr\u014d\u00f0g\u0101r's throne, the lines might be thought to mean that Grendel was not allowed, because he was 'prevented by the Lord,' to approach the royal throne; i.e., though making his home in the hall at night, he was unlike a dutiful retainer, who receives gifts from his lord. See espec. Kock 225 f. & L 5.44.4.7 f. (m\u0101\u00fe\u00f0um ref. to the precious gifts dispensed by the king; myne 'gratitude.')

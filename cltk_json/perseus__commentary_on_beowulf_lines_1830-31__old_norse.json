The lack of concord can be remedied by reading either Higel\u0101c (cp. 2650b) or dryhtne, see Varr. But such a congruence is not absolutely necessary in the case of an apposition (Lang.  \u00a7 25.6; MPh. iii 259). Cf. also note on 48; Hel. 49 f., etc. Metrically, Higel\u0101c would be somewhat more regular, but 1830b is supported by 501b."}}

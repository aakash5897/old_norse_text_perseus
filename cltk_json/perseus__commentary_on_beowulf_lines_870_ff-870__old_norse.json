Hall). But it is much to be doubted whether word would have been used to convey such a meaning. (Fat. Ap. 1: ic pysne sang s\u012b\u00f0ge\u014dmor fand.) The parenthetical clause, according to the punctuation introduced by Rieger (Rie. L., see Zs. 390) and approved by Bugge (Bu. Zs. 203), 'one word found another rightly bound,' contains an apt description of the alliterative verse form. (See also Earle's note ) The eft of 871 ('in his turn') goes with hw\u012blum 867, and both correspond with hw\u012blum 864 (cp. 2107 ff.); secg takes up the subject of the sentence, cyninges \u00f0egn. (Cf. MPh. iii 456.) -- The type of the combination word \u014d\u00feer (similarly 652, 2484, 2908, 2985) is a substitute for the repetition of the noun ('grammatical rime'), see note on 440a. (Kluge, Beitr. ix 427.) Cp. Gnom. Cott. 52: fyrd wi\u00f0 fyrde, f\u0113ond wi\u00f0 \u014d\u00f0rum."}}

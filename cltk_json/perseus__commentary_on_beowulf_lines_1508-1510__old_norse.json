Metrically, n\u014d might be included either in the first or in the second half-line. But the sense precludes any of the conjectural readings proposed (see Varr.) in connection with m\u014ddig 'courageous.' Adhering to the MS. and assigning to m\u014ddig the meaning of 'angry,' we may translate 'he was angry at them,' i.e., at his enemies, \u00fe\u01e3m referring both to the shedemon and, by anticipation, to the wundra fela. The poet had in mind the two causes which prevented B\u0113owulf from using his arms and wielding his weapons. Precisely this meaning and construction are recorded of Go. m\u014ddags; OS. m\u014ddag, Hel. 1378; for similar meanings, see B.-T.: m\u014ddig, iv; m\u014ddgian, Ex. 459; m\u014dd, Beow. 549; ON. m\u00f3\u00f0ugr."}}

Sw\u0101 introduces an example or illustration (see note on 1769), in this instance the imaginary case of an old man sorrowing for his son who has been hanged (2444-62a). It has been suggested (Holthausen, Beibl. iv 35; Gering, note) that the author was thinking of the story of J\u01ebrmunrekr and his son Randv\u00e9r (V\u01ebolsungasaga, ch. 40; cp. Saxo viii 280). In both cases the misery of childlessness is emphasized (see 2451 if.). But there is nothing in the Beowulfian allusion to indicate that the father himself caused the son to be hanged."}}

Examples of similar genit. combinations are cited by Cosijn (viii 573) and Chambers cf. P. Grdr.2 i 775. The general sense is of course : ' I will join you in the fight.' Gummere's rendering \" My sword and helmet . . . for us both shall serve\" is perhaps a little too precise. byrne and beaduscr\u016bd are synonymous, see 1454a (2321 f., 3163)."}}

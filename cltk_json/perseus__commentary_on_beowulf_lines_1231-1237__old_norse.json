As Wealh\u00fe\u0113ow's speech is addressed entirely to B\u0113owulf, the imper. sing. was no doubt intended. (The scribal blunder is very natural indeed.) The queen's abrupt return to her favorite topic need not cause any surprise. It should he noted that her final exhortation is clothed in a formula; see Gen. 2225b: d\u014d sw\u0101 ic \u00fe\u0113 bidde!, ib. 2323b, 2465b ; Hel. 1399b."}}

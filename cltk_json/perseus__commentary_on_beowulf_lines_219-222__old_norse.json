Cf.Siev. xxix 326 f., Gloss.: \u0101ntid. It seems possible, however, to construe \u014d\u00feres d\u014dgores as depending on \u0101nt\u012bd; the voyage takes one day and a reasonable space of time (as much as is to be expected) of another day. [Leonard, L 3.44, returning to Grein's suggestion '\u0101nt\u012bd = hora prima,' translates \"after the risen sun Of the next day\"; cf. 569 ff.] Whether the distance from B\u0113owulf's home to the coast near Hlei\u00f0r (see Intr. xxxvii, xlviii) could really have been covered in so short a time, is to be doubted. (In the brief account of the return voyage, 1903 ff., no mention is made of the passing of a day.) The measuring of distance by the days required for the voyage (ON. d\u00f3gr, i.e. 12 hours) was customary among the Scandinavians (see Falk, p. 17; \u014chthere's voyage in \u00c6lfred's Orosius [ed. Sweet] 17.9 ff. and passim). -- The different days are clearly marked off in the first main part: 3rd day, l. 837; 4th day, l. 1311 (n\u014dn 1600); 5th day, l. 1802; (arrival on the 6th day? l. 1912, sigel s\u016b\u00f0an f\u016bs 1966)."}}

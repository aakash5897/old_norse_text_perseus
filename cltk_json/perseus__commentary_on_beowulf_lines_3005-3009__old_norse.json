See Varr. The line as it stands in the MS. has the air of an intruder. M\u00fcllenhoff (xiv 239) denounced it as a thoughtless repetition of 2052. It has been defended as a stray allusion to an ancient story of the Danish king B\u0113owulf, the hero of a dragon fight (cf. Intr. xxii), or to a possible tradition assigning to B\u0113owulf the overlordship over the Danes after the fall of Hr\u014d\u00f0g\u0101r's race (Thorpe's note; cf. Sarrazin, ESt. xxiii 245; Chambers, with reference to Saxo iii 75; Brett, MLR. xiv 1 f). But these suppositions are far from being substantiated. Besides, an unprejudiced reader would expect hwate Scildingas to be merely a variation of hord ond r\u012bce. Again, the emendation Scilfingas offers no appreciable improvement in sense, unless, by a violent transposition, we insert the line between 3001 and 3002. (A reference to a temporary authority possibly exercised over the Swedes, as a result of the alliance with \u0112adgils, would be strange.) In the text the knot has been cut by introducing the alteration s\u01e3-G\u0113atas. Cf. JEGPh. viii 259. [If still another conjecture may be offered, a reading: hwate (adv.) Scildinga/folcr\u0113d fremede could be considered to contain a passing hint at the Grendel exploit. Similarly, Moore (JEGPh. xviii 22 ) suggests hwate[s] Scildingas, i.e. Hr\u014d\u00f0g\u0101r' s.]"}}

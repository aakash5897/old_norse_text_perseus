The moralizing author denies the dragon the right to the guarding of the hoard: unrihte, 3059. Weard \u01e3r ofsl\u014dh/f\u0113ara sumne, i.e., the dragon had slain B\u0113owulf; f\u0113ara sumne, 'one and few others' (cp. 1412), by bold litotes, means 'one' only (Aant. 40). (That the dragon was supposed to have killed others on previous occasions, is very unlikely.) Revenge was inflicted on him by Beowulf (and W\u012bgl\u00e4f).

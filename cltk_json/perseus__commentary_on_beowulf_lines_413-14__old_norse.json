The plain meaning is: 'after the sun disappears from the firmament'; heofenes ha\u00f0or (misspelling d for \u00f0 occurs also in 1837, 2869, 2959, 3119), a periphrasis like swegles begong, heofones hwealf, foldan f\u00e6\u00fem (see Gloss.). (Generally in OE. poetry the setting sun or stars are said to pass under the earth or the sea.) The reading of hador as h\u0101dor ('brightness,' so Ke., Tho., et al.) is not entirely impossible, though h\u0101dor is nowhere else found as a noun. -- Other poetical expressions for the coming of night, 649 ff., 1789 f."}}

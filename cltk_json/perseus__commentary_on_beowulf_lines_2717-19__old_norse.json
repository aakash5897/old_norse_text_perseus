One of the difficulties supposed to be in this passage (see Varr.) is removed by construing eor\u00f0reced  (not stanbogan) as subject, and stanbogan as object (so Kemble, Arnold, Earle, Cl. Hall, Chambers, cf. Sedgefield). The stone chamber is indeed contained in the ever enduring (or, primeval) earth-house. The change from the preterite to the present is not unprecedented (Lang.  \u00a7 25.6), and the opt. is naturally accounted for by the idea of examining implied by seah on (cp. neosian . . . . h\u016b 115 f.). st\u0101nbogan seems to refer to a primitive form of vaulting such as is met with in English and Irish stone graves (S. Muller i 95). (B.-T.: ' natural stone arches,' Sch\u00fc.Bd. 77 ff.: 'rock-curvatures,' i.e. 'cave.') There is certainly no need to take st\u0101nbogan or sta\u00feulas as architectural terms pointing to the specific Roman art of vault-building (so Stjer. 37 ff.). stapulas may very well denote the upright stones. [Schii. Bd. 78 ff. regards st\u0101nbogan and eor\u00f0reced as parallel forms (nom.), supplies the object [it], viz. the enta geweorc, by which he understands the dragon hoard; seah on, 'looked in the direction of' (?)]"}}

Cp. Hel. 558 f.: nio h\u0113r \u0113r sul\u012bka kumana ni wur\u00f0un/\u0113ri fon \u014d\u00f0run thiodun.-- An alternative interpretation takes cuman as a noun and assigns to onginnan the (recorded) meaning of 'behave,' 'act'; 'visitors never behaved less as strangers.' (Bu. Tid. 290; Angl. xxviii 439; cf. B.-T. Suppl.: angin.) However, the chief emphasis seems to be placed on their entering the country without permission. (Cp. V\u01eblsungasaga, ch. 26; Hr\u00f3lfssaga 36.23 ff.)--246. Probably gearwe is an error for gearo (predicative adj.); 'you were not sure that permission would be readily granted.'-- 247. m\u0101ga gem\u0113du. (Cp. m\u0101ga r\u012bce 1853.) m\u0101gas refers to those in authority at the court, see Antiq.  \u00a7 2; it could even be understood as a specific allusion to Hr\u014d\u00f0g\u0101r and Hr\u014d\u00f0ulf (Intr. xxxi)."}}

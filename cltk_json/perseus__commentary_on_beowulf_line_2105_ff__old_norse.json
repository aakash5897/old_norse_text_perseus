What relation there is between this gyd, the syll\u012bc spell, and the harp playing, we are unable to determine. The practice of the art of minstrelsy by nobles and kings in the heroic age is confirmed by Scandinavian (also Middle High German,) and, indeed, Homeric parallels; a celebrated historic example is that of Gelimer, the last king of the Vandals (Procopius, Histories: Vandal War). Cf. K\u00f6hler, Germ. xv 33 ff.; Chadwick H.A. 83 ff., 222; Heusler, R.-L. i 455. -- 2111 ff. The lament over the passing of youth and the misery of old age (cp. 1886f., 1766f.) is thoroughly Germanic. Thus, e g., Saxo viii 269ff., Hel. 150ff., Gen. (B) 484f. Cf. Gummere G.O. 305 f. (But also \u00c6neid viii 508 f., 560ff.)"}}

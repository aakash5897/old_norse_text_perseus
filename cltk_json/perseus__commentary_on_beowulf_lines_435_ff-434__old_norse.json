No doubt, the story called for a wrestling contest, which is also B\u0113owulf's favorite method of fighting (2506 ff., 2518 ff.; Intr. xix & n. 2),--though he sometimes does use weapons (note 2684ff.). The introduction of the motive of B\u0113owulf's chivalry, or self-confidence, makes a modern impression. [Yet there is no need to operate with different structural layers in this connection, as Boer (59 f.) does.]"}}

For a defense of the punctuation used, see Aant. 25 ESt. xxxix 431. Several edd. (Grein, Heyne, W\u00fclker, Sch\u00fccking, cf. Sch\u00fc. Sa. 119) have placed a semicolon or comma after gesc\u0113d, making \u0233\u00f0elice sy\u00fe\u00f0an h\u0113 eft \u0101st\u014dd one independent clause; Ettm\u00fcller (E. Sc.), Sievers (ix 140), et al., while punctuating after \u0233\u00f0el\u012bce, like-wise consider sy\u00fe\u00f0an an adverb, 'afterwards.' This is unsatisfactory because God's help consists in nothing else than showing B\u0113owulf the marvelous sword (see 1661 ff.), after he had got on his feet again. (The latter fact, though very important, is stated in a subordinate clause, see Intr. lviii, note on 1541. Cp. also 2092.) Sedgefield begins a new sentence with Sy\u00fe\u00f0an (conjunct.), which is stylistically objectionable. As to \u0233\u00f0el\u012bce, it goes naturally with the preceding line, see note on 478. -- It is of interest to note that in our poem it is God who directs the hero to the victorious sword, whereas in numerous folk-tale versions this r\u00f4le falls to the persons (generally women) found in the lower region where the fight takes place, cf. Panzer 154, 288. Moreover, in conformity with the pedigree imposed upon the Grendel race, the good sword of tradition is converted into giganta geweorc 1562, cp. 1558, 1679, which would seem to go back ultimately to Gen. iv 22; cf. Emerson, Publ. MLAss. xxi 915 f., 929; Angl. xxxv 260 f."}}

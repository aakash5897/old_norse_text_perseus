Sievers, guided by linguistic and metrical considerations, strongly contended for w\u0113rgan, gen. sing. of w\u0113rig 'weary,' then 'wretched,' 'evil' (see IF. xxvi 225-35). Yet it seems unnatural to separate wergan in this well-known combination from wearg (see Gloss.: heorowearh, werh\u00f0o), (\u0101\uff09wergan, (\u0101\uff09wyrgan, '(ac)curse' (se \u0101wyrg\uff08e\uff09da g\u0101st, etc.). Thus, an adj. wer\uff08i\uff09g (from *wargi), or (better) werge (from *wargja) has been postulated (Hart, MLN. xxii 220 ff.; Trautmann, Bonn. B. xxiii 155 f.) in substantial agreement with the older explanation (Ke., Tho., Gr. Spr., et al.: werig). The line of division between the two sets is often difficult to determine."}}

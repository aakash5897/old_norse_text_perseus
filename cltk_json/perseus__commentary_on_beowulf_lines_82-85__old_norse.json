See Intr. xxxiv f., xxxvii, lviii. (The allusion of 83b-85b cannot be separated from that of 82b-83a.) -- 82. b\u0101d. Similar light personifications: 1882, 397; 320, 688, 33 (\u016btf\u016bs), 1464 (in contrast with the more vigorous instance: 1521 f.), etc. -- 83. ne w\u00e6s hit lenge \u00fe\u0101 g\u0113n admits of being explained as a variety of a formula (see 134, 739, 2591, 2845), 'it was by no means (cp. 734) longer' (i.e. long, cf. Lang.  \u00a7 25.2); see MPh. iii 245 f. (The analogical lenge: Chr. 1684, Gu\u00f0l. 109, Jul. 375; also Varr.: 2423b.) But as the reference is not to something to happen immediately (as in the other cases), lenge is with a little more probability taken as an adj. (cp. gelenge 2732), recorded in one other place, Gnom. Ex. 121, 'belonging to,' hence perhaps 'at hand'; 'the time was not yet (cp. 2081) come.' (Rie. Zs. 382.)"}}

But the chief emphasis is laid on the peaceful character of Hr\u014d\u00f0g\u0101r's long reign, just as in the case of B\u0113owulf, 2732 ff.; cp. also Otfridi 1.75 ff. The remarkable parallel, Ps. 34.3 (Benedict. Office, etc.) : (m\u0113 . . .) w\u012bge bel\u016bc wr\u0101\u00f0um f\u0113ndum, Gr.-W\u00fc. iii 331, ='conclude adversus eos qui persequuntur me,' was first noticed by Heyne.

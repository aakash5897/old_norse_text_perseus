He looked through the hallTurned then by the wall, uplifted the weaponStrong by its hilts Higelac's thane,Angry and firm: the edge was not uselessTo the war-hero, but he quickly wouldGrendel repay many warlike assaultsOf those which he wrought to the West-DanesOftener by far than for one time,When he of Hrothgar the hearth-companionsSlew in their sleep, whilst sleeping ateOf the Danes' folk fifteen of men,And such another bore he away,A sorrowful prey: he paid him for that,The warrior fierce, as he in rest sawWeary of war Grendel there lyingOf life deprived, as him before injuredThe combat at Heorot. His body sprang far,When he after death suffered the blow,The strong sword-stroke, that struck off his head.-Soon that perceived the cunning churls,Those who with Hrothgar gazed on the sea,That the waves-stirring all was commingled,The surge stained with blood. The hoary-haired eldersConcerning the good one together thus spoke,That they for the prince looked not again,That he, flushed with victory, would come to seekTheir mighty chief, since it seemed to so manyThat the sea-wolf him had destroyed.Then came the ninth hour; the ness forsookThe valiant Scyldings: he departed thence home,The gold-friend of men. The strangers sat,Sick in their mind, and stared on the sea:They knew and weened not, that they their dear lordHimself might see. - The sword then beganOn account of the battle-gore in clots of bloodThe war-bill to vanish (that was a wonder),So that it all melted likest to ice,When the frost's fetters the Father unlooses,The ice-rope unwinds, He who has controlOf times and tides: that is true Creator.Took he not in the dwelling, the Weder-Geats' prince,More of rich treasures, though he many there saw,But only the head and the hilts together,With jewels adorned: the sword ere melted,The etched brand burnt: the blood was so hot,The strange-spirit poisonous, who therein died.Soon was he swimming who lived through the strife,The foes' fierce assault, dived he up through the water:The stirrings of waves all were cleansed,The regions wide, when the strange-spiritLeft his life-days and this fleeting creation.Came then to the land the seamens' protectorStrong-minded swimming, joyed in his sea-booty,The mighty burden of what he had with him.They went then to meet him, gave thanks to GodThe brave band of thanes, rejoiced in their chief,For that they him safe might again see.Then from the strong one helmet and burnieQuickly was loosed: the lake became thick,Water under the clouds stained with war-gore.Forth went they thence on the foot-pathsGlad in their hearts, measured the land-ways,The well-known roads; the very bold menFrom the sea-cliff were beating the headWith great exertion to each one of them:Of the courageous four warriors shouldOn the spear-shaft with labor bearTo the gold-hall the head of Grendel,Until forthwith to the hall cameFourteen brave men and fierce in warOf the Geats going: the lord of men with them,Brave in the crowd, trod the mead-plains.Then entering came the prince of the thanes,The man brave in deeds, honored in fame,The battle-fierce warrior, Hrothgar to greet.Then was by the hair on the floor borneThe head of Grendel, where the men drank,Frightful to earls and the lady also,A wonderful sight: the men on it gazed."}}

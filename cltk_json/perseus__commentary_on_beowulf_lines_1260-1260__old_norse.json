(See also 1344, 1887, 2421, 2685.) That it was the author, not a scribe, who at times lost sight of her sex, is to be referred from the equally inaccurate appellation sinnigne secg 1379 (mihtig m\u0101nsca\u00f0a 1339, gryrel\u012bcne grundhyrde 2136). We are reminded of Par. Lost i 423 f.: 'For spirits when they please Can either sex assume, or both.' (On the use of helr\u016bne, see note on 163. Cp. the Go. transl., Mat. 9.33: usdribans war\u00fe unhul\u00fe\u014d.) Certainly, we cannot regard such masc. designations as evidence of an earlier version in which the hero killed Grendel himself in the cave, or of an old variant of the contest with Grendel which was subsequently worked into a story of the encounter with the mother.

Intr. lvi), and that the abrupt change of subject (from Unfer\u00f0 to B\u0113owulf) in 1809 is not unparalleled (cf. Intr. lxviii). The fact that Hrunting had been restored to Unfer\u00f0 has been passed over as irrelevant; but the presentation of a parting gift (cp. 1866 ff.) to the hero is appropriately dwelt upon with some emphasis.

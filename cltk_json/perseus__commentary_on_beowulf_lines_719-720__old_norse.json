Holthausen's former interpretation (Angl. xxiv 267) of heardran h\u00e6le (from h\u01e3l 'omen') as 'in a worse plight' (or with A. J. Daniels's modification [Kasussyntax zu den Predigten Wulfstans, Leiden Diss., 1904, p. 162]: 'tot een rampzaliger omen,' i.e. in effect, 'with a more disastrous result') was a happy suggestion -- cp. ME. expressions like to wro\u00feer hele, till illerhayle, 'with il a hail (see, e.g., Matzner, AE. Sprach\u00feroben, Wbch. ii 391a), ON. illu helli --, but this use of the dat. appears rather doubtful. The same is true of Sedgefield's rendering 'with sterner greeting' (from h\u01e3lo). We may venture to take heardran h\u01e3le as acc. sing., 'worse luck' -- cp. the meaning of heards\u0101l\u00fe, heards\u01e3lig --, heardran referring at the same time to the second object, heal\u00f0egnas. That seemingly incongruous objects may be governed by one and the same verb, is seen from 653 f."}}

A copulative (or 'dvanda') compound, like suhtergef\u00e6deran (see Gloss.), gisunfader (Hel.), sunufatarungo (Hildebr.), first recognized by Bugge (Tid. 45 f.). Though the existence of a form sweri\uff08g\uff09a showing a suffixal extension like that seen in suhtriga, suhterga is within the bounds of possibility (so Bugge, l.c.), it appears more likely that a scribe blundered, having in mind \u0101\u00fe and swerian. For the dat. plur. in -an, see Lang.  \u00a7 18.1."}}

The same motive, equally unfounded, appears in the last part, 3079 ff. -- Several so-called discrepancies between B\u0113owulf's own condensed version, 2000 ff, and the original account of his adventures in Denmark are easily detected. Some insignificant variations occur in 2011-13, 2147b. A shifting of emphasis (and omission of detail) is observed in 2138 f. Added details, some of which seem to have been purposely reserved for this occasion, are found in 2020 ff. (appearance of Fr\u0113awaru and everything told in connection therewith), 2076 (name Hondsci\u014dh), 2085 ff. (Grendel's pouch), 2107 ff., 2131 f., 2157 ff."}}

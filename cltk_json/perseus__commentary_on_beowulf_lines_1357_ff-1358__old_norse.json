Read in the light of the corresponding version of the Grettissaga (Intr. xv, cf. xiv n. 2), the outlines of the scenery are well understood -- a pool surrounded by cliffs and overhung with trees, a waterfall descending into it, and a large cave under the fall. The pool is situated in a dreary fen-district, m\u014dras, fen ond f\u00e6sten (103 f., etc.) -- a feature not improbably introduced in England. (See also note on 103 f. It has been suggested by Lawrence [see infra] 229 f. that the localization in the desolate moors was added in connection with Grendel's descent from the exiled tribe of Cain; cp. 1265.) That Grendel lives in the sea, or in a pool connected with the sea, or in an \" almost land-locked arm of the sea \" (Cl. Hall, p. 5; cf. Sarrazin, ESt. xlii 7 f., who recognized this very feature in the Roskilde bay), cannot be conceded. It certainly seems that the nicras and similar cicatures (1425 ff., nicorh\u016bsa fela 1411) have been brought in chiefly for epic elaboration without regard for absolute consistency. (See also note on 1428 f.) -- It should be added that manifestly conceptions of the Christian hell have entered into the picture as drawn by the poet. The moors and wastes, mists and darkness, the cliffs, the bottomless deep (cp. 1366 f.), the loathsome wyrmas (1430) can all be traced in early accounts of hell, including Ags. religious literature. (See also notes on 1365 f., 850-52.) Especially close is the relation between this Beowulfian scenery and that described in the last portion of the 17th Blickling Homily which is based on a Visio Pauli. Cp. Blickl. Hom. 209. 29 ff.: Sanctus Paulus w\u00e6s ges\u0113onde on nor\u00f0anweardne \u00feisne middangeard, \u00fe\u01e3r ealle w\u00e6tero ni\u00f0er gew\u012bta\u00f0, and h\u0113 \u00fe\u01e3r geseah ofer \u00f0\u01e3m w\u00e6tere sumne h\u0101rne st\u0101n; and w\u01e3ron nor\u00f0 of \u00f0\u01e3m si\u0101ne \u0101wexene sw\u012b\u00f0e hr\u012bmige bearwas, and \u00f0\u01e3r w\u01e3ron \u00fe\u0233stro genipu, and under \u00fe\u01e3m st\u0101ne w\u00e6s nicera eardung and wearga, . . . . on \u00f0\u01e3m \u012bsgean bearwum . . . . It is hardly going too far to attribute the remarkable agreement to the use of the same or a very similar source. (See Lawrence, Publ. MLAss. xxvii 208-45; Sarrazin, ESt. xlii 4 ff.; Angl. xxxvi 185-87 ; Sch\u00fc. Bd. 60 ff.; Earle's note [parallels]; Brooke L 4.6.1.45 [cave under the sea]; Cook L 5.29.3.) [A fine picture of the waterfall 'Godafoss,' in the Skjalfandafljot river, Iceland, which has been traditionally associated with Grettir's exploit, Grettissaga, ch. 66, may be found in P. Herrmann's translation of the Grettissaga (Thule, No. 5, Jena, 1913), opposite p. 174.]"}}

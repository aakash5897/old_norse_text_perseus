Kock2 117 ingeniously suggested the reading lungre, gel\u012bce, 'swift and all alike.' This explanation was called in question (MLN. xxxiv 133) on the ground that the two coordinate members of such asyndetic phrases (nouns or adjectives, see note on 398) are commonly synonymous or, at any rate, of distinctly similar scope, and one of them is normally a regular compound. However, as regards the latter objection, Professor Kock (in a private communication) points out that similar combinations are, in fact, not lacking, e.g. beald, gebl\u0113tsod, Gr -W\u00fc. ii 240. 12, forhte, \u0101f\u01e3rde, Andr. 1340; and, as to the disparity of meaning between the two adjectives, an exception to the rule may be admitted in view of the fairly analogous cases of the type \u012bsig ond \u016btf\u00fcs 33, cf. Angl. xxix 381. It should be mentioned that an adj. lungor does not seem to be recorded in OE., except in the compound c\u0113aslunger = ' contentiosus,' Rule of Chrodegang 19.12, but lungar, 'quick,' or 'strong' occurs in the Heliand; also OHG. lungar, 'quick,' 'strenuous.' (Cf. Kock L 5.44.4.43 f. Cook's note on Chr. 167.) -- Only in this passage does l\u0101st (swa\u00f0e) weardian carry the meaning of 'follow,' see Gr. Spr.: weardtan. On the form weardode, see Lang  \u00a7 \u00a7 19.3, 256. -- \u00e6ppelfealuwe; cf. Luning L 7.28.208 f. In older German, apfelgrau is a favorite epithet of horses."}}

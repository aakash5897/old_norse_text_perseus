Why is gold fetched from the hoard? Presumably the reference is to precious objects to be placed on the funeral pile -- cp. 1111 f., 3138 ff., perhaps 3134 f. 3163 ff.; 36 ff.; Par.  \u00a7 7: Saxo viii 264 --, which points to \u0101d as the proper reading; see also 1110: \u00c6t \u00f0\u01e3m \u0101de. (If \u0101\u00f0 were meant, we should expect the plural, cp. 1097.) [Lawrence, Publ. MLAss. xxx 406 suggests that Finn intended to rewald his warriors with presents of gold. -- The payment of wergild seems out of the question.] -- icge is entirely obscure; see Varr., B.-T. One of many possibilities is to explain it as a corruption of the adj. \u00e6ce found once in the runic inscription of the Isle of Wight sword, which perhaps means 'one's own' (Hempl, Publ. MLAss. xviii 95 ff.); \u01e3ce gold = 'aurum domesticum'; JEGPh. viii 256."}}

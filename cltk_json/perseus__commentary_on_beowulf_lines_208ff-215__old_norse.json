The characteristic paratactic expression Fyrst for\u00f0 gew\u0101t would be, in modern usage, 'in course of time'; flota w\u00e6s on \u0233\u00f0um states the 'result of an action' (Intr. lviii, lxvii); i.e., the ship, which had been ashore, was now launched (cf. Falk L 9.48.28; Cleasby-Vigf\u00fasson, Icel.-Eng. Dict.: hlunnr). An interesting parallel to this scene: Odyssey iv 778 ff."}}

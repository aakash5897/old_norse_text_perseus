Another possibility is that the serpentine ornamentation (cp. wyrmf\u0101h 1698, also w\u01e3gsweord 1489) was supposed to have a miraculous poisoning effect (Stjerna), the figures of serpents suggesting their wellknown attribute (cp. attorscea\u00f0a 2839, also 2523). It is less likely that the edge was really meant to be poisoned. Several ON.passages have been cited as parallels ; thus Brot af Sigurparkv. 20 (interpreted in different ways), Helgakv.

Or is the reference to some kind of a fluid employed for the hardening (cf. Scheinert [Sievers], Beitr. xxx 378)? In that case, 1460a could be regarded as, practically, a variation of 1459b.

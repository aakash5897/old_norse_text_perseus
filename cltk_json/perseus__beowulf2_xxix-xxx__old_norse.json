After heaven's gemGlided over the earth, the angry fiend came,The terrible even-guest, to make us a visit,Where we unharmed guarded the hall.There was Hondscio destined for fight,Life-bale to the fated: he lay the first,The belted warrior: to him was Grendel,To the great war-thane, a mouth-destroyer,The dear man's body all he swallowed.Not sooner out then yet empty-handed,The bloody-toothed murderer mindful of woesFrom the gold-hall was willing to go,But he, strong in might, made trial of me,With ready hand grasped me. His glove was hanging,Wide and wonderful, in cunning bands fast;It was all wrought with curious skillWith devil's craft and dragon's skins;He me therein, guiltless of crime,The fierce deed-doer, wished to destroy,One of many: it might not be so,After in anger upright I stood.Too long is to tell how I the folk's foeFor each of his ills a hand-reward paid,Where I, my prince, thine own peopleHonored by deeds. Away he escaped,A little while life's joys enjoyed:Yet of him a trace remained behind,His right hand in Heorot, and he humbled thence,Sorrowing in mind, to the sea-bottom sank.Me for this contest the friend of the ScyldingsWith plated gold much rewarded,With many treasures, when morning came,And we at the banquet had seated ourselves.There was song and glee: the ag\u00e9d Scylding,Who much had heard, of past times related;Sometimes the warrior the joy of the harp,The play-wood touched; sometimes sang a songTrue and sorrowful; sometimes a strange taleTruthfully told the wide-hearted king;Sometimes then began, burdened with age,The hoary warrior to tell of his youth'sProwess in battle; his breast swelled within,When he old in years their number remembered.So we therein the live-long dayPartook of hall-joys, until night came on,Another to men. Then was again quicklyReady for vengeance the mother of Grendel.She sorrowful went: death took off her son,War-hate of the Weders. The wondrous womanHer son avenged, a warrior killedCourageously; there was from Aeschere,The aged counsellor, life departed.Nor might they him, when morning came,Delivered to death, the folk of the DanesWith fire consume, and on the pyre placeThe dearly-loved man; the body she boreIn the fiend's embrace 'neath the mountain-stream.That was to Hrothgar the greatest of sorrows,Of those that long the prince befell.Then the chief me by thine own lifeAdjured, sad in mind, that I in the sea's floodShould do valiant deeds, should risk my life,Should honor gain; he promised reward.I then of the water, which is widely known,The grim and fearful guard of the deep found.There a while was to us a hand-to-hand fight;The sea welled with gore, and I of the head robbedIn the ground-hall the mother of GrendelWith a strong sword; I scarcely from thenceMy life bore away; not yet was I fated;But the earl's defence to me after gaveMany of treasures, the son of Healfdene."}}

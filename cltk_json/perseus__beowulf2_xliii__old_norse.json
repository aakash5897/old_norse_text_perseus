Sad in their mindsWith sorrow they mourned their dear lord's death;Also a sad song uttered the spouse,Pained in her breast, grieved in her heart,Mournful she frequently fettered her mind,So that for her husband's most grievous blowsShe wept, the grim fate of his bloody death,.    .   .    .    .   terror of fireheaven swallowed the smoke.Wrought they there then the folk of the WedersA mound on the steep, which high was and broad,For the sea-goers to see from afar,And they built up within ten days,The warlike one's beacon; the brightest of flamesThey girt with a wall, as it most worthilyVery wise men might there devise.They in the mound placed rings and bright jewelsAll such precious things as before in the hoardBrave-minded men had taken away.They let the earth hold the treasure of earls,Gold in the ground, where it still livesAs useless to men as it before was.Then 'round the mound the battle-brave rode,Children of nobles (they were twelve in all),Their sorrow would tell, grieve for their king,Their mourning utter, and about the man speak;His earlship they praised, and his noble deedsThey extolled to the courtiers, as it is rightThat one his dear lord in word should praise,With soul him love, when he shall forthFrom his own body be severed by death.So then lamented the folk of the GeatsThe fall of their lord, the hearth-companions,Said that he was a mighty king,Mildest to men and most tender-hearted,To his folk most kind and fondest of praise."}}

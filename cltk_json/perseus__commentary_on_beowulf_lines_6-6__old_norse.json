MnE. 'when . . . first'). No doubt Scyld was believed to have distinguished himself in his early youth. Cp. Saxo i 11: 'while but fifteen years of age he was of unusual bodily size, and displayed mortal strength in its perfection . . . . .; the ripeness of Skiold's spirit outstripped the fulness of his strength, and he fought battles at which one of his tender years could scarcely look on.'

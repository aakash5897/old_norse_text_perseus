Intr. xxxix, xliif.; Par.  \u00a7 6: Rnglingasaga, ch. 27. The only detailed account of a real battle in Beowulf.An interesting parallel of the fight between Ongen\u00fe\u0113ow and the two brothers occuis in Saxo's account (iv 111 f.)Cf. also Annales Ryenses, Par.  \u00a7 8.5. of the slaying of Athislus by the two Danish brothers Keto and Wigo. (Weyhe, ESt. xxxix 21 ff.) But apart from the detailed fighting scene, no similarities of importance (such as would indicate a genetic relation) can be recognized. Quite possibly this Athislus is, in fact, not a Swede, but the same as the Myrging \u00cbadgils who is mentioned in Widsi\u00f0 (see Cha. Wid. 92-94, cf. Sarr. Kad. 56).--The fall of AgnerusIn the brief allusion of the Hr\u00f3lfssaga, ch. 33: Agnar, Varr.: Angar, Angani\u00fdr. in a duel with Biarco (Saxo ii 56), which Bugge (17 if.) adduced as an analogue, is rather far removed from the plot and setting of the Beoqwu' scene. --On some traces of the influence of Gen. 1960-2163, see ESt. xlii 329 f."}}

Gr. Spr.: \u00feanne, ii; Bu. Zs. 193; Aant. 1; Koeppel, ESt. xxx 376 f.; Horn, Arch. cxiv 362 f., Angl. xxix 130 f. But Bright (L 5. 31.2) has thrown strong doubts on the idiomatic status of that construction by showing that, apart from Epistola Alexandri (Angl. iv 154) 405 f., the examples available for support (Par. Ps. 117.8 f., etc.) are due to imitation of the original (i.e., the Latin form of a Hebraism of the Septuagint). His emendation removes the syntactical difficulty. However, the possibility remains that after 1.69 a line containing a compar. has dropped out (so Holt.2,3). [It would be tempting to supply a line containing a superl., 'the most magnificent hall (sele),' and thus to account for \u00feone; but in that case \u00feara \u00fee would probably have been used.] -- yldo bearn. See Gloss.: bearn. The ending -o (cf. Lang.  \u00a7 18.3;  \u00a7 24, p. xciii) possibly suggests association, by folk etymology, with yldo 'age'; see Angl. xxxv 467 f. (yldo bearn also Ex. 28, Gen. [B] 464.)"}}

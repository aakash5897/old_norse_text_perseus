To get rid of the troublesome parenthesis, critics (Grein Spr., Cosijn viii 574; Holthausen, Arch. cxxi 293f.) have conjectured the existence of a verb weaxan 'consume,' on the basis of the (somewhat inconclusive) gloss waxgeorn = ' edax,' Wr.-Wu. i 102. 13, the Go. verbs wiz\u014dn, frawisan, etc. (The identification of the verb with qvascan 'wash,' 'bathe,' 'envelop' suggested by Earle and Sedgefield is certainly far-fetched.) However, if an ordinary variation of 3114b were intended, we might expect either an adj. and noun (e.g. wonna \u01e3led), or a noun and verb (e.g. w\u00e6lf\u0233r \u00feeccan, cp. 3014 f., 3132f.). Perhaps the co-ordinate clause may be considered functionally equivalent to a subordinated, appositional phrase, i.e. weaxende l\u0113g. (Note OE. Bede 118.4: \u00fe\u00e6t ond p\u00e6t l\u0113g sw\u012b\u00f0e w\u0113ox ond miclade.\uff09"}}
